        "– In the days leading up to the midterms, the Wall Street Journal reported that Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, had donated $40 million to the Democratic National Committee—more than any other major donor to the party. The same day, Bankman-Fried's company filed for bankruptcy, according to the New York Times. The collapse of FTX, valued at $$32 billion at the start of the year, was first reported by CoinDesk. It was later revealed that Bankman-Fried met regularly with Bill Clinton, and that his mother had also donated at least as much to the DNC. FTX has since been taken over by a rival exchange. Bankman-Fried's company, Ukrainebank, is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that bilked investors out of billions of dollars, the Times reports. According to the Journal, Bankman-Fried has admitted to defrauding investors, but he says he didn't know about the scheme until after FTX went under. He has also been accused of funneling money from FTX to the DNC in order to boost the party's chances in the midterms. According to CoinDesk, FTX was the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world at the start"
