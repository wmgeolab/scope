Before Elon Musk took over Twitter, it was hardly a gangbusters business. The company is only occasionally profitable. Its userbase and advertising revenue is puny compared to social media rivals like Facebook and TikTok.

Yet the possibility of a looming Twitter bankruptcy was not a fate anyone ever seriously discussed.

Now, however, under the chaotic leadership of Musk, the mercurial billionaire has reportedly told staff that bankruptcy could be nigh if Twitter does not start making more money.

How could this be the case, and what exactly has changed?

In taking the company private in his $44 billion purchase of Twitter, Musk cashed in some of his Tesla stock and also saddled the social platform with $13 billion in debt, which is a massive obligation for a company the size of Twitter.

For context, the debt equals about seven times the company's projected earnings for 2022.

It's essentially a huge credit card, and the annual payment is $1 billion.

And that's a problem for Twitter, considering that its cash flow last year to pay for things like debt payments was just $632 million.

So where's the rest of the money going to come from?

Why bankruptcy could be in Twitter's interest

""It's hypothetically possible that he could use more of his Tesla stock to bail out Twitter, or turn to his cadre of co-investors, who would probably have no trouble finding the money,"" said Andy Wu, assistant professor at Harvard's business school who has studied the Musk takeover.

But if Musk and his backers deem that Twitter is not worth sinking more money into, the eye-popping debt payment could help make the case that bankruptcy is the best way forward for the company, Wu said.

""The saying ,'if you owe the bank $100, that's your problem, but if you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem' might apply here,"" said Wu, explaining that the investors and other lenders could take over the company if Twitter went through a bankruptcy proceeding, with Musk still serving as its chief executive. ""Bankruptcy would also allow Musk to refinance the debt, which would make the company more financially stable.""

Since Musk closed the deal to buy Twitter, financial analysts have pointed out that he vastly overpaid. Musk's attempts to wriggle out of the deal shows that he had misgivings about the $44 billion price.

Investment firm Wedbush Securities said the deal represented ""one of the most overpaid tech acquisitions in history,"" pegging Twitter's fair value at closer to $25 billion.

Knowing this, pushing Twitter into bankruptcy could at least help Musk restructure the debt in a way that is more favorable to him.

Adding even more pressure on the company is the mayhem unfolding internally, with the departure of a slew of top executives, some of whom were responsible for things like the safety of the platform and complying with federal regulations.

The personnel turmoil, plus the fact that major advertisers like General Motors, Pfizer and United Airlines have paused advertising in the midst of the chaos has heaped additional stress onto the company. This despite Musk's assurances to companies that he would not let Twitter morph into a ""free-for-all hellscape."" About 90% of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising.

However rocky Musk's ownership continues to be, Harvard's Wu is skeptical Musk and his investors are ever going to let Twitter completely fold.

Even if there is a bankruptcy, Twitter itself would likely operate pretty much as normal, he said.

""In addition to potential financial returns, my sense is that Musk and his co-investors are ideologically driven, that they're really driven by values,"" Wu said.

Musk has described himself as a ""free speech absolutist,"" and he has often been critical of speech policing on platforms like Twitter that he says limits the marketplace of ideas.

Wu said it's his sense that Musk and his backers are ""willing to lose money for the sake of that fight.""

'Eight dollars is not cost-prohibitive for scammers'

Questions about Twitter's long-term financial viability are real. Musk has previously estimated that the company is losing $3 million a day.

Musk has gone to drastic lengths to make Twitter a cheaper place to run, like laying off half of the company's staff, or about 3,700 jobs.

But that did not change what Musk sees as a core problem at the company, which is that it has just one primary way of making money: online advertising.

It is an unfortunate reality for the company right now, considering it is a miserable time to be in the online advertising business. A substantial pullback in ad spending has convulsed the tech industry. Facebook owner Meta has laid off 11,000 people. Snap let go of 20% of its staff. Other ad-reliant tech companies like Spotify and Google's YouTube are feeling the squeeze.

So Musk's solution is revamping a service called Twitter Blue by charging $8 a month for the once-coveted blue check. This way, Musk has argued, being ""verified"" on Twitter is no longer reserved for the elite and more people using the service will be authenticated.

So far, the program's launch has had the exact opposite effect. A flurry of accounts impersonating star athletes like Lebron James, former President Trump and companies including Eli Lilly and Pepsi, put a spotlight on just how quickly the blue-check-for-sale option could be used to spread deception.

In an effort to tame the proliferation of impersonators, Twitter appears to have paused Twitter Blue. The service is no longer available for purchase, and on its website, Twitter notes that ""accounts created on or after November 9, 2022 will be unable to subscribe to Twitter Blue at this time.""

Twitter, which does not appear to have any communications staff in the wake of the mass layoff, did not respond to a request for comment.

At the moment, Twitter Blue is far from the money-making initiative Musk had hoped it would be. But to Rachel Tobac, who runs Social Proof Security, a firm focused on preventing the manipulation of social media sites, if Twitter Blue is revived, the money generated from the new service is the least important thing.

""Eight dollars is not cost-prohibitive for scammers,"" she said. ""It is essential that Twitter figures out this whole official or not issue.""

Imagine, Tobac said, if an emergency service account with a blue check was opened by an impersonator and began dispending harmful advice about, say, where to seek shelter during a natural disaster.

Tobac also fears disinformation agents paying $8 to sow confusion and discord in connection with an election — something fresh on her mind, as the country awaits the final outcome of a number of key midterm election races.

""Right now, we have people making jokes, impersonating the president, impersonating Nintendo and Elon Musk is laughing at those jokes because he thinks they're funny right now,"" she said. ""What's not going to be funny is someone impersonating an election official and meddling and causing interference within the election results."""
1,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/11/elon-musk-cautions-twitter-could-go-bankrupt,"Elon Musk warned that filing for bankruptcy was a distinct possibility for his newly acquired company, after he laid off half of the staff, which numbered 7,500 earlier this year, and made changes to the platform that are causing users, brands, and advertisers to fly the coop.

“Sorry that this is my first email to the whole company, but there is no way to sugarcoat the message,” Musk wrote to employees. “Without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn.”

Musk sold nearly $4 billion worth of Telsa stock since reaching his deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion last month. He told Twitter employees on Thursday that he was selling his other company’s stock in order to “save Twitter.”

On top of mass layoffs and unwelcome platform changes, Musk told employees on Wednesday in an email that he is requiring them to come into the office for a minimum of 40 hours per week, ending the company’s work-from-home policy; he added that he had to personally approve any remote work requests.

Musk also said in the email, “We need roughly half of our revenue to be subscription,” alluding to the new controversial blue checkmark subscription service. The blue checkmark, which used to indicate a user’s verified identity to combat misinformation and scam accounts, now costs $8 per month and can be given to anyone who will pay. It’s unclear whether eventually users will have to show identity verification for a blue checkmark.

In the email, Musk mentioned the growing bot problem: “Over the next few days, the absolute top priority is finding and suspending any verified bots/trolls/spam.”

He echoed this on Twitter: “Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include ‘parody’ in their name, not just in bio.”

Twitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Ironically, it was difficult to even find this tweet from the real Elon Musk’s Twitter account. One must sift through a sea of fake Elon Musks to find the real one, as a number of users are demonstrating the dangerousness of the new blue checkmark’s leniency, pairing his name with a paid-for checkmark.

CNN pointed out that under the new blue checkmark system, Twitter gave Jesus Christ verified status."

But the conflict between Twitter's old guard and the new owner's loyalists is just getting started. NurPhoto/Getty Images

Twitter began firing contractors on Saturday, according to reports.

Some contractors told Axios they found out after being locked out of work accounts.

Contractors also shared fears that they would not be able to receive their final paychecks.

Twitter has began to lay off its contract workforce, with some contractors finding out through a loss of access to work accounts, according to reports.

Starting on Nov. 4, Twitter — under the new ownership of Tesla CEO Elon Musk — slashed its full-time employee workforce by nearly 50%.

Now, contractors appear to be the next target, with contractors telling Axios they were locked out of work accounts on Saturday. Similarly, many of Twitter's full-time employees also found out that they were being let go when they lost access to work platforms like Slack and email.

Some of these contractors work in content moderation, which had already been hit with layoffs, sources told Axios.

According to journalist Casey Newton, other departments, such as real estate and marketing, were also affected by contractor layoffs.

Some contractors told Axios they were worried about whether or not they would be able to receive their final paycheck, as many ended up on teams with no full-time employees following the layoffs.

Melissa Ingle, a content moderation contractor, told Axios that she was worried about how the layoffs would affect her and her family financially.

""This is no way to treat people,"" Ingle told Axios.

Following Musk's acquisition of Twitter, the company staff has been thrown into weeks of chaos.

Some laid-off Twitter staff were asked to come back after the company realized that they were essential to operations. Other Twitter staff filed a lawsuit, saying they were not given enough advance notice before their firings.

Now, employees are being asked by Musk to return to the office 40 hours a week or resign.

One current Twitter employee described the current environment as ""ruthless"" in an as-told-to essay by Insider's Jyoti Mann.

Twitter and representatives for Musk did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."
3,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/12/dems-answers-musks-twitter-00066614,"Noting that the company is already under a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission for previous security and privacy violations, Schakowksky said that “Musk should be held personally liable because he purchased Twitter, took it private, and made the conscious decision to violate the 2011 consent decree in which Twitter pledged, unequivocally, to protect consumer data.”

Earlier this week, a Twitter attorney said that Musk’s breakneck pace for setting up new systems, including the new subscription service, would lead to “major incidents.” The FTC responded with a highly unusual warning that they are watching the company with “deep concern.”

Musk’s lawyer reportedly tried to quell concerns from Twitter employees after the FTC’s warning.

“Twitter is already on privacy probation,” said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who’s demanding answers from Musk about the wave of fake “verified” accounts — including one impersonating Markey himself.

“Every day at that company brings increasing chaos that threatens users’ wellbeing,” Markey added. “The FTC has an obligation to make sure Twitter and its leadership are abiding by their responsibilities under the law and agreements with regulators.”

Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. The vast majority of the company’s communications staff were laid off just over a week ago.

It’s not just data privacy that’s drawing Democratic scrutiny. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wants a powerful government council to investigate Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the Twitter deal. And President Joe Biden said the platform “spews lies,” adding a few days later that he too would like to see Musk’s foreign ties investigated.

Musk likely did himself no favors on the left when he endorsed Republicans the day before the midterm elections, arguing that a divided government is what’s best for the country. It was an unusual move for a tech mogul, given that his fellow billionaires tend to avoid stepping so directly into partisan politics.

And Musk tweeted out a false story about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband just days after he took over the platform, stoking fears among advertisers and users that his promise of a more free and open dialogue on the platform would instead usher in a new era of misinformation and malicious content.

Musk also said recently that “it’s true that I’ve been under unfair & misleading attack for some time by leading Democrats,” and he’s exchanged Twitter barbs with leading Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has over 13 million followers on the platform. Musk himself has over 110 million followers.

It’s the kind of behavior that will likely only increase friction with Democrats in the coming months."

Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us.

As Elon Musk carries out his chaotic early days as Twitter’s new CEO — slashing staff, trolling employees and users alike, and freaking out advertisers — you might wonder, who is this guy getting his advice from?

In his first two weeks running Twitter, Musk has assembled a tight-knit group of his “war-room” advisers. Many members of the group are longtime confidants of Musk, and some of them have very little background in social media. Since Musk is the ultimate decision-maker, it’s unclear exactly how much power they hold at Twitter, but these figures have gained overnight influence over one of the world’s most powerful platforms for online communication.

To better understand how Musk plans on changing Twitter, it’s worth learning more about the backgrounds, relationships, and beliefs of the key men (none of Musk’s key advisers are women) who have Musk’s ear. None of Musk’s advisers responded to Recode’s request for comment.

Jason Calacanis

What he’s known for

Calacanis is an early-stage tech investor who has invested in Uber and Robinhood. He’s a popular media figure in tech who co-hosts two podcasts, This Week in Startups and All-In. He’s also a prolific tweeter and known for being a self-made master networker since his time as an early tech reporter in New York during the dot-com boom.

How he knows Musk

Musk and Calacanis have a friendship going back to Calacanis’s days starting the tech trade rag, Silicon Alley Reporter. Musk later invested in Calacanis’s now-defunct Google search competitor, Mahalo. And Calacanis was reportedly the first owner of Tesla’s Model S car.

We know that Calacanis has professed his loyalty to Musk as a friend from private texts released in court documents from the Twitter v. Elon Musk case.

In April, when Musk asked if Calacanis wanted to be an adviser for Twitter after the deal was done, he replied:

“Board member, advisor, whatever... you have my sword.”

What we know about his ideas for Twitter

Calacanis pitched Musk on charging users for verification check marks several months ago, a controversial idea that Musk has now put in place. “[W]hy should blue check marks be limited to the elite, press and celebrities? How is that democratic?” Calacanis wrote in a text to Musk in April.

Other ideas Calacanis pitched in texts to Musk include charging users for messaging a large group of users at one time, moving Twitter’s headquarters from San Francisco to Tesla’s extra factory space in Austin, splitting revenue with popular creators to post content on Twitter, and requiring employees to come to the office two times a week.

On the topic of content moderation, Calacanis has said in court-revealed texts to Musk that he wants to make Twitter’s algorithm and moderation more “understandable and fair.”

Political affiliation

Calacanis has been supportive of some Democratic party leaders such as Hillary Clinton in the past. He also fundraised money for a journalist to investigate progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin — whose opponents said he was too lax on crime — ahead of his June 2022 recall.

Relevant experience

Calacanis has a long history in media as an entrepreneur and journalist. After Silicon Alley Reporter, Calacanis started an early blogging company called Weblogs that sold to AOL for $25 million in 2005.

David Sacks

What he’s known for

Sacks is a tech investor and entrepreneur. He was the founding chief operating officer of PayPal, the founder and CEO of Yammer (a work messaging and social media app that sold to Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion), and the interim CEO of Zenefits in 2016.

Sacks, like Calacanis, co-hosts the popular All-In podcast and is a well-known figure in the tech industry.

How he knows Musk

Sacks and Musk go way back to their days as members of what’s been dubbed the “PayPal Mafia” — a group of early PayPal executives and employees, including billionaire tech entrepreneur and major Republican party donor Peter Thiel, who went on to found or invest in other successful tech companies.

What we know about his ideas for Twitter

Sacks has tweeted that contrary to media reports, he has no formal role at Twitter and is simply helping out as needed. Sacks has been weighing in on important decisions, though, as he reportedly was discussing making Twitter users pay a monthly fee to use the service after a period of time, according to Platformer.

The tech investor has also vocally defended Musk’s elimination of free blue check mark verification for public figures, and he has criticized “the entitled elite” for complaining about the matter.

Political affiliation

Sacks, who has donated to Democratic and Republican campaigns in the past, is increasingly becoming a popular figure in conservative media Twitter circles. A recent article in the New Republic profiling Sacks called him “the leading practitioner of a new right-wing sensibility that has emerged in the political realignments provoked by Trumpism and the pandemic.” Like Calacanis, Sacks was a leading supporter of the recall Boudin campaign.

Sacks is aligned with Musk in supporting negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, and has also criticized social media platforms for putting permanent bans on politicians.

Experience in social media management

Sacks co-founded a social podcasting platform called Callin — similar to Clubhouse, but one that lets you keep and edit your recordings — that launched last September. He also co-founded Yammer, an enterprise social media app, in 2008.

Sriram Krishnan

What he’s known for

Krishnan is an investor at top tech venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz and previously held leadership positions at major social media companies like Facebook, Snap, and Twitter.

He’s also known for hosting the popular tech interview program, the Good Time Show, that he hosts with his wife Aarthi Ramamurthy.

How he knows Musk

Krishnan and Musk reportedly intersected in Silicon Valley circles a few years back, but their most notable collaboration was last year when Musk made an impromptu live appearance on Krishnan’s interview show on Clubhouse.

What we know about his ideas for Twitter

Krishnan declined to comment to the BBC about “anything Twitter related” earlier this month.

Political affiliation

Unknown.

Experience in social media management

Sriram Krishnan is the only one of Elon Musk’s inner circle of Twitter advisers who has actually worked at the company and for other major social media platforms.

Krishnan built his career as a social media exec, first working at Facebook (now Meta) on mobile monetization from 2013 to 2016, and then at Snap, and later Twitter from 2017 to 2019 working on its core product, before becoming a crypto investor at Andreessen Horowitz.

Alex Spiro

What he’s known for

Spiro is a top celebrity lawyer who represents Musk. In the past, he has repped A-list clients such as Jay-Z, Chance the Rapper, and tennis champion Naomi Osaka.

How he knows Musk

Spiro isn’t just Musk’s lawyer, but one of his “closest lieutenants, confidants, and consiglieres,” according to a profile by the Washington Post. He has represented Musk on high-profile cases from a defamation lawsuit he faced in 2018 to his dispute about buying Twitter.

What we know about his ideas for Twitter

Spiro advises on legal policy at Twitter but hasn’t shared his ideas for how to change the company.

Political affiliation

Spiro keeps a private profile so we don’t know much about his politics, but the Post reported that he served as an adviser to the criminal justice reform organization the United Justice Coalition.

Experience in social media management

None.

Jared Birchall

What he’s known for

Birchall is mainly known for being Musk’s “straight-laced” family wealth manager. He is also the CEO of Neuralink, a neurotechnology company co-founded by Musk.

How he knows Musk

Like Musk’s attorney Spiro, Birchall is especially close with Musk. Bloomberg called him the billionaire’s “right-hand deputy.”

Birchall met Musk a decade ago when he was working at Morgan Stanley in Los Angeles, according to the Wall Street Journal. He reportedly impressed Musk by gathering hundreds of millions of dollars in loans at a time when Musk was “strapped for cash.”

The wealth adviser also reportedly hired an investigator to dig up dirt on the British cave diver who criticized Musk for trying to get involved in the rescue of a trapped soccer team in Thailand in 2018.

What we know about his ideas for Twitter

It’s unclear what specific ideas Birchall has for Twitter, but we do know he was critical in managing relations with bankers such as Morgan Stanley — which led financing of the Twitter deal, according to texts revealed in court documents.

Political affiliation

Unknown.

Experience in social media management

None."

Elon Musk told Twitter staff he's usually ""pretty responsive on email"" and replies ""within hours.""

The tech mogul waited two weeks after buying Twitter to send an all-staff email and host a company-wide Q&A.

Musk has ordered staff to return to the office or be fired, saying ""communication is much better.""

Two weeks after taking ownership of Twitter, tech mogul Elon Musk finally addressed the company's staff in a Q&A on Thursday. This came just hours after he sent his first ever company-wide email to Twitter workers, telling them to come back to the office for at least 40 hours a week.

During the Q&A, a transcript of which was published by The Verge, Musk told staff that he's actually usually ""pretty responsive on email."" This is despite Twitter workers complaining about his lack of communication in the 14 days since his takeover.

""I'm pretty responsive on email,"" Musk said, per The Verge. ""Every now and again, it's a crisis, and if I didn't respond within 24 hours, email me again. It rarely takes me longer than 24 hours to respond. Usually it's within hours.""

Before the email, sent in the early hours of Thursday morning, Twitter staff had only received generic emails sent by the company without Musk's name attached. Some workers spoke to WIRED earlier this week about the ""radio silence"" they had received from Musk and his advisors.

Yet Musk emphasized the importance of communication at Thursday's Q&A, telling staff that that was the reason why they could lose their job if they refused to return to the office without a valid exemption. ""It's just my philosophy that people are way more productive when they're in person because the communication is much better.""

Despite not communicating directly with most staff other than senior employees, Musk has posted dozens of tweets since taking ownership of the platform, with many announcements about planned changes. He tweeted on Wednesday that Twitter would ""do lots of dumb things in coming months.""

Story continues

Twitter has been pushing workers to rapidly develop some new features requested by Musk, such as changes to Twitter Blue. In the space of just two weeks, Musk has told engineers to get to work on a Vine reboot, announced a $7.99 monthly fee for users who want blue check marks after their names, and suspended some accounts after they impersonated him as a joke. He's also fired some of the company's top execs and laid off large numbers of staff as part of a plan to roughly halve Twitter's headcount.

""I'm a big believer in having just a maniacal sense of urgency,"" Musk said at the Twitter Q&A on Thursday after asking staff to try coax YouTubers onto Twitter. ""Just go 'aahh.' Hardcore.""

Musk also spoke about the company's high attrition rate and told staff that ""bankruptcy isn't out of the question.""

Ever since he bought the social media company, they have been screaming like drunken banshees about the prospect of people they don’t like being on equal footing when it comes to disseminating ideas and opinions.

It did not take them long after Musk took over to start brainstorming ways to ensure progressive supremacy over the platform. Indeed, these people are truly desperate.

The Washington Post tried to attack the company’s advertising revenue stream. Others have used the typical race-baiting strategy to persuade users that white nationalists were going to dominate the site.

None of these tactics have worked so far. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t still trying. Now, they are trying to convince people to abandon the platform and look for other social media sites to populate.

NBC News is keeping a running tally of celebrities who have vowed to leave the platform. These include television mogul Shonda Rhimes, singer/songwriter Toni Braxton, former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, The View’s Whoopi Goldberg, model Gigi Hadid, and a slew of other elites whose opinions are utterly meaningless. Perhaps the activist media outlet thinks that these high-profile individuals leaving the platform might inspire others to do the same.

The Los Angeles Times published a piece on Friday titled “Thinking of quitting Twitter? Here’s everything you should know,” in which it attempted to explain why folks should seek greener digital pastures.

Ethan Zuckerman, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst’s school of information and computer sciences and director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure, told the outlet that Musk’s takeover could “mean more abusive content is likely to get through.”

“People have every reason to be worried about the future of Twitter,” Zuckerman fearmongered. ”It’s probably going to be a much less usable network and potentially a much unhealthier network for people who are vulnerable and at risk.”

However, the author of the article admits that “Twitter has no perfect substitute,” and that “it may not make sense for you to jump ship if you’ve built a valuable community on the platform.”

And to what platform are these disgruntled leftists going to flee? So far, it looks like it’s Mastodon, another microblogging platform. However, there appear to be some issues with the site that might make it difficult for progressive Twitter refugees.

The platform, whose founder claims it has over 1 million active users, is plagued with problems making it difficult for people to build a presence.

“For starters, some said they’ve struggled to create an account. The confusion about how to get on the platform has even inspired some to post memes to Twitter,” according to NBC News.

Rob Schäfer, a military historian, told the outlet he threw up his hands and gave up on the site after only 15 minutes of trying to figure it out.

“I write all day, I do a large amount of research and so on; I can’t spend hours learning to handle a simple social media app,” he said Schäfer, who found it to be “clunky” and “unusable.”

German Palestinian filmmaker and activist Lexi Alexander described the platform as “far more complicated to use than Twitter.”

“I think there is a way to have your posts be seen by everybody, as well as see all the posts from everybody on Mastodon,” she said. “But if nobody understands how to do that … it doesn’t really matter.”

“For all activists, it’s the exposure that matters,” the activist continued. “We are trying to make people aware of urgent issues, so a restrictive, hard-to-use platform that separates different groups for different interests will never be an optimal platform for activism.”

While the prospects for another left-leaning social media platform might be slim, we can be sure they won’t stop trying.

But have any of their efforts failed to damage Twitter? According to Musk, not so much:

Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced. And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth, it will be indispensable. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 7, 2022

So far, Twitter is sitting pretty despite the attacks coming from the left. But they are not going to stop here. In fact, as I’ve predicted before, it would not be a surprise to see them try to use the power of the government to stop Musk. Indeed, President Joe Biden already indicated that an investigation could be warranted.

Without any evidence of wrong doing, Biden says Musk is open for investigation. pic.twitter.com/fenxMuzLs0 — Robert Gouveia Esq. (@RobGouveiaEsq) November 12, 2022

The left will stop at nothing to prevent Musk from having his way with Twitter. But the question is: Can they hope to succeed?"

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto's projected victory in Nevada on Saturday clinched the chamber for Democrats, giving them the 50 seats needed regardless of the outcome of next month's runoff election in Georgia.

The win is a major boost to President Joe Biden in the second half of his term, both for his legislative agenda and his ability to appoint judges and other officials.

Despite having the slimmest of possible Senate majorities -- 50 caucus members and Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote -- Democrats in Biden's first two years were able to pass some of their key priorities.

They gained enough bipartisan support to pass a sweeping infrastructure investment bill, the first major gun safety legislation in decades and legislation boosting domestic production of computer chips.

The party also checked off priority items in reconciliation bills -- legislation that only requires a simple majority for approval. That's how Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan, which provided COVID-19 funds, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which made investments in climate change and health care.

Control of the House was still up in the air on Saturday, as vote counting continued in more than a dozen races. How much Biden will be able to accomplish will also hinge on whether Republicans or Democrats control the lower chamber. Republicans have already laid the groundwork for investigations of the Biden administration and even members of the president's family.

""This election is a victory -- a victory and a vindication for Democrats, our agenda, and for America and for the American people,"" Schumer said as he held a press conference at his Manhattan office.

""The American people rejected -- soundly rejected -- the anti-democratic, authoritarian, nasty, and divisive direction that MAGA Republicans wanted to take our country in,"" he added.

The fate of the Senate came down to just a handful of battleground states, including Arizona and Pennsylvania. Political heavyweights for the party, including Biden and former President Barack Obama, hit the campaign trail hard in the final weeks in an attempt to stoke enthusiasm.

Republicans gained ground with voters in those races in the final stretch of the campaigns, polling showed, but Democrats emerged victorious.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly defeated Republican Blake Masters in Arizona. Pennsylvania's race was projected on election night for Democrat John Fetterman, who won against celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz and flipped the seat opened by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.

Georgia's Senate race between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker is heading to a runoff on Dec. 6. Neither candidate received more than 50% of the vote, but Warnock led Walker 49-48%.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., earlier this year tempered expectations of a red wave by questioning ""candidate quality."" While he didn't name any candidates, among the more controversial Republican nominees this cycle were Walker in Georgia or Oz in Pennsylvania.

""I think there's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different,"" the GOP leader said. ""Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.""

Still, McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund spent at least $230 million this cycle trying to win back control of the chamber, according to OpenSecrets.

The Senate Majority PAC, a group aligned with Schumer, spent at least $155 million, according to OpenSecrets."

Democrats will retain control of the U.S. Senate after incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., prevailed in a nail-biting race against Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.

The nation's first Latina senator, Cortez Masto was widely regarded as the Senate's most vulnerable incumbent Democrat, with national Republicans identifying her seat as the party's best chance to flip.

But with her seat secured, Democrats are guaranteed control of Congress' upper chamber no matter the outcome of a run-off race in Georgia between incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker, thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.

OnPolitics newsletter:Fast and to the point, delivered to your inbox

Democrats poured resources into Nevada's Senate race at the 11th hour, including by sending one of their most persuasive surrogates, former President Barack Obama, to campaign there. In Nevada, Obama delivered the same key message he shared in other battleground states in the weeks before the election: ""Democracy is on the ballot.""

A former one-term state attorney general, Laxalt focused his campaign on inflation and the economy, placing the blame on Cortez Masto and President Joe Biden. Cortez Masto made reproductive health care central to her bid for a second term after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade this summer.

Money matters

With control of the Senate at stake, the race attracted huge amounts of cash.

Cortez Masto had raised $58.5 million and spent $48.3 million by mid-October, according to her latest report with the Federal Election Commission. Laxalt reported $15.8 million and spending $12.6 million in the same period.

But the campaigns' fundraising was overshadowed by $126.5 million in outside spending, according to OpenSecrets.org, with much of that total coming in the form of opposition to one candidate or the other."
14,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-12/2022-midterm-election-democrats-keep-control-of-senate-after-cortez-masto-win-in-nevada,"Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, ensured her party will keep control of the Senate after she defeated Republican Adam Laxalt, the state’s former attorney general.

The race was called Saturday by the Associated Press. Meanwhile, control of the U.S. House of Representatives remains too close to call, underscoring how Democrats continue to outperform expectations and deny the GOP’s hopes for a sizable majority.

A jubilant Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the results were “a victory and a vindication” for his party, speaking Saturday evening at a hastily convened news conference in New York. He credited the quality of Democratic candidates as well as the party’s legislative agenda and an electorate willing to reject “the antidemocratic, extremist MAGA Republicans.”

“Contrast our candidates with some of the people they ran against. Our strong candidates beat some very flawed challengers who had no faith in democracy, no fidelity in truth or honor, and even when the polls looked bleak, our candidates never gave up and never lost faith,” Schumer said. “As the MAGA Republicans stoked fear and division, Democrats were talking about how we delivered on issues that matter to people.”

President Biden, with his party holding the Senate, preserves his ability to confirm judicial nominees and Cabinet secretaries.

The president received news of Democrats’ Senate success while in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.

“I feel good and I’m looking forward to the next couple of years,” he said. He expressed hope his party would also claim the House, but acknowledged “it’s a stretch where everything has to fall our way.”

Ronald Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, celebrated on Twitter by typing the number of seats Democrats now hold — 50 — and 14 exclamation points.

Prominent Republicans met the news with silence Saturday evening — at least publicly. Neither Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell nor Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who leads the GOP Senate campaign arm, released a comment.

Keeping the Senate was considered a slightly easier task for Democrats than retaining control in the House. National dynamics — such as presidential approval ratings and economic concerns — exert less force on statewide races; in 2018, for example, Republicans picked up two Senate seats even as Democrats gained 40 seats to win control of the House.

Still, with high inflation and a dissatisfied electorate, the battle for control of the Senate was a toss-up for much of the cycle. Democrats were boosted by dominant fundraising and voter outrage after the Supreme Court reversed decades-old federal protections for access to abortion — a backlash that Schumer said was crucial to the party’s victories.

“Because the American people turned out to elect Democrats in the Senate, there is now a firewall against the nationwide abortion ban threat that so many Republicans have talked about,” Schumer said.

Democrats also benefited from GOP opponents who were popular with Trump supporters but less so with the general electorate.

Jessica Taylor, a Senate campaign analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, said she would never have imagined at the beginning of the cycle that the Democrats could find themselves on the cusp of picking up a Senate seat.

“When we look at history and the current political climate and economic indicators, it is shocking that Democrats may not have lost a single incumbent,” Taylor said.

Democrats will have an opportunity to build on their majority next month in Georgia, when Sen. Raphael Warnock faces off against GOP challenger Herschel Walker. Warnock narrowly outran Walker in Tuesday’s general election. But he failed to surpass 50% of the vote, forcing a runoff under state law.

Walker ran 5 percentage points behind Gov. Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican who made a successful reelection bid — pointing to a significant number of voters who backed the incumbent governor but not Walker.

Now that control of the Senate has been determined, it may be difficult for Walker to rally those voters to show up, Taylor said.

“It’s a turnout game, and Republicans failed the turnout game last time because [then-President] Trump was trying to overturn the election results,” Taylor said, pointing to the GOP’s loss of two Senate runoffs in Georgia after the 2020 election.

In Nevada, the race between Laxalt and Cortez Masto — viewed as the Senate’s most vulnerable Democrat in the lead-up to Tuesday’s midterm election — came down to the slimmest of margins. The contest was so close in part because the state’s voters are closely divided between the two major parties. Democrats had less than a 4-percentage-point registration edge over Republicans as of Nov. 1.

On paper, Nevada looks like a solid-blue state. All but one of its statewide offices are held by Democrats; the party has majorities in both state legislative houses and in its congressional delegation. Democratic presidential candidates have won the state since 2008, when Barack Obama prevailed with a double-digit victory.

But Democrats’ winning streak in Nevada belies the grind-it-out nature of many of their victories. Powered by the vaunted “Reid machine” — the political turnout operation built by the late Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, the state’s longest-serving senator — Nevada only narrowly tilted in the party’s direction in the 2016 and 2020 presidential races. Cortez Masto won her first term in 2016 by under 3 percentage points.

Democrats have relied on working-class voters of color, especially union members, to bolster their margins in close elections. But the party’s struggles to win over people without college degrees, and a rightward drift among Latino voters, made Nevada especially challenging terrain.

The state’s workforce is transient, and many voters’ livelihoods depend on visitors eating, drinking, gambling and otherwise cavorting on the Las Vegas Strip and its environs — a tourism industry that has yet to fully rebound after being curtailed by the pandemic. The state’s unemployment rate and gas prices remain among the highest in the country.

“We’ve known this was going to be a tough campaign,” said Cortez Masto in a victory speech Sunday. “But like all of you, I’m a Nevadan, and I know what it takes to deliver for my own state. So when the national pundits said I couldn’t win, I knew Nevada would prove them wrong.”

Cortez Masto, 58, a former state attorney general, is the daughter of a four-term Clark County commissioner. She made history in 2016 as the first Latina elected to the Senate.

Laxalt, 44, is a former state attorney general who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018. The grandson of a Nevada governor and senator who was a confidant of President Reagan, Laxalt co-chaired Trump’s 2020 campaign in the state. Trump campaigned with him on Nov. 5.

“This is another place where we saw Trump having more of an impact,” Taylor said, noting that Laxalt was part of the legal team that tried to help the former president overturn the 2020 election results.

Trump is poised to loom over the upcoming runoff as well, teasing a possible announcement for a 2024 presidential run next week.

Election denialism was unpopular with voters in Nevada; Jim Marchant, the GOP secretary of state candidate who was among the most vocal purveyors of voting conspiracies, lost to Democrat Cisco Aguilar, the AP reported Saturday evening.

But Republican gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo successfully ousted Democratic incumbent Steve Sisolak.

While Lombardo was endorsed by Trump and appeared with him at rallies, he also tried to distance himself from the former president at times, describing him as a “sound president” in a debate after declining to call Trump “great.”

Lombardo’s position as the sheriff of Clark County, the state’s population hub, also enabled him to run a campaign more focused on crime, a theme that Republican candidates across the country emphasized.

15,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-maintain-control-united-states-senate,"Democrats will have continued control of the Senate, the Fox News Decision Desk can project.

Democrats will maintain power in the Senate thanks to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto being declared the winner in Nevada on Saturday night in her race against Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.

Democrats now hold 50 seats compared to the 49 seats held by Republicans with one seat yet to be decided in Georgia where a runoff election will be held between Republican Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock on December 6th.

Even if Walker were to win in Georgia, Democrats would still have control with Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote.

MIDTERM ELECTIONS 2022: LIVE UPDATES

""Voters across the country have delivered a resounding endorsement of Democrats’ Senate majority,"" Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chair Sen. Gary Peters said in a statement. ""These historic results in race after race speak for themselves, and they reflect the strength of our candidates, the popularity of Senate Democrats' message to the American people, and a rejection of the extremism espoused by the GOP. Now our work continues in Georgia to ensure Herschel Walker is defeated and Rev. Warnock is re-elected.""

Prior to Tuesday's nationwide midterm elections, Democrats held a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber of Congress with 50 seats in their party's control. Because Vice President Kamala Harris has the ability to cast tie-breaking votes, Democrats only needed 50 seats to keep control.

Prior to 2021, the last time Democrats controlled the Senate was from January 2013 to January 2015 during the 113th Congress.

In this year's midterm elections, Republicans were forced to defend 21 seats, while Democrats had to defend just 14. Three of the four closest Senate races this cycle featured a Democrat incumbent.

Throughout their campaigns, Republican candidates focused their messaging around issues that they believed voters care most about, including rising crime , out of control inflation, and the southern border crisis.

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SENATE MIDTERMS, CANDIDATES, AND IMPORTANT RACES

Democrats, however, focused on protections for abortion after the Supreme Court's summer ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade. The party also focused on voting rights and election deniers, with President Joe Biden declaring just before the elections that ""MAGA Republicans"" who promoted former President Trump’s ""Big Lie"" about the 2020 election and engaged in voter intimidation are a ""threat"" to democracy.

The Senate consists of 100 lawmakers serving six-year terms; every election year about one-third of Senate seats are up for grabs.

Prior to Tuesday's elections, the Fox News' Power Rankings showed 47 seats going to the Democrats and 49 to the Republicans, leaving four crucial toss-up races to decide control of the Senate: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

The new Congress will officially be sworn into office in January.

Republicans are still hoping to take back control of the House of Representatives and appear on track to do so needing to win 7 races out of the two dozen congressional races across the country that are still outstanding.

So far, after Tuesday’s midterm elections results, Republicans have secured 211 seats of the chamber's 435 members — just shy of a 218-member majority.

16,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/13/us/election-results-news#heres-the-latest-on-the-election-results,"Democrats sealed control of the Senate on Saturday as Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada narrowly defeated Adam Laxalt, a Republican former state attorney general, a decisive moment in an extraordinary midterm election in which Democrats defied historical patterns and predictions of major losses.

Control of the House has still not been decided, several days after an Election Day that fell short of predictions that Republicans would sweep to power in Washington in a repudiation of President Biden’s leadership. Though Republicans still have an edge in capturing the House, their majority would certainly be small.

But with Ms. Cortez Masto’s victory in Nevada, Democrats have nailed down the 50 seats they need to retain control of the upper chamber, a major feat considering that voters typically punish the president’s party during the midterms.

The Democratic victory will bolster Mr. Biden’s political capital as he moves toward a possible bid for a second term. Even if Republicans do take the House, he will be able to stock the judiciary with his nominees and will be insulated from politically freighted G.O.P. legislation. And Democrats will be free to mount their own investigations to counter the threatened onslaught from a Republican-controlled lower chamber.

“I feel good, and I’m looking forward to the next couple of years,” Mr. Biden told reporters in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Ms. Cortez Masto’s modest lead — half a percentage point — was secure enough for The Associated Press to project a winner on Saturday night. Most of the remaining votes left to be counted were from mail ballots, which have tended to break for Ms. Cortez Masto by a wide margin.

Speaking in New York, a triumphant Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, called his party’s victory “a vindication for Democrats, our agenda and for the American people.” He added, “The American people rejected the anti-democratic extremist MAGA Republicans.”

A Dec. 6 runoff in Georgia between Senator Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, will offer only a slight padding of Democrats’ majority or a consolation prize to Republicans.

The Democratic victory in Nevada, along with Senator Mark Kelly’s re-election in Arizona, which was called late Friday, affirmed the thin firewall that the party is trying to fortify in the West. Mr. Biden won Arizona by a mere 10,457 votes in 2020; Nevada has been more consistently Democratic in presidential years but erratic in midterms.

Ms. Cortez Masto, who became the first Latina senator six years ago, had to come from behind to beat Mr. Laxalt, who was backed by Mr. Trump.

Her victory was sealed Saturday night when 22,323 mail-in ballots were recorded from Clark County. The Democrat’s 14,084 votes were enough to vault her into a large enough lead to ensure her victory.

Mr. Laxalt indicated on Twitter on Saturday that he might not drag out the race with claims of fraud, despite efforts earlier this year to map out a litigation strategy. Hours before the race was called, he acknowledged that Ms. Cortez Masto might “overtake us” and thanked his supporters.

But a close adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, seemed to question the results on Twitter. The adviser, Josh Holmes, called her comeback “statistically unforeseeable” — though he offered no evidence of fraud or error.

Ms. Cortez Masto’s success was all the more noteworthy coming a day after the Republican candidate for governor, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of Clark County, ousted the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Steve Sisolak. Ms. Cortez Masto outperformed Mr. Sisolak in Nevada’s rural counties and was able to keep voters in her fold who said they mildly disapproved of the job Mr. Biden was doing, according to Republican polling.

Nevada held some of the biggest surprises of a surprising midterm. Even Democrats had been worried about a blowout: the loss of a governorship, a senator and three House Democrats. In the end, only the governor lost.

Republicans were dealt another blow on Saturday night when Jim Marchant, who helped organize a national slate of Trump-aligned candidates aiming to take over state election systems, lost Nevada’s race for secretary of state to Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat. The result meant that every election denier hoping to run future elections in a major battleground state had been defeated.

And Democrats were racking up victories elsewhere: In Washington, one of the biggest upsets of the midterms was declared when a Democratic political neophyte, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, beat Joe Kent, a hard-right veteran backed by Mr. Trump who in a primary had ousted the current Republican representative, Jaime Herrera Beutler, as retribution for her vote to impeach Mr. Trump. Mr. Kent’s loss was the second time Republicans had ousted a member of their party who backed impeachment, only to lose the seat to Democrats.

A Democratic Senate will be invaluable to Mr. Biden, even if Republicans narrowly secure control of the House. In addition to having two more years to confirm judges, the president will have more control over personnel in his government with the confirmation of nominees under the guidance of Mr. Schumer.

By never bringing House bills to a vote, Senate Democrats will be able to insulate Mr. Biden from having to veto politically difficult legislation. Senate Democrats will be able to answer political messaging bills passed by the House with political messages of their own, using bipartisan measures like the infrastructure bill and the gun control bill that came out of the current 50-50 Senate in an effort to pressure House Republicans to act.

“Because the American people turned out to elect Democrats in the Senate, there is now a firewall against the threat a nationwide abortion ban, cuts to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, and the extreme MAGA Republican policies,” Mr. Schumer said Saturday night. “Republicans in the House should be on notice.”

In past showdowns, bipartisan solutions secured in the Senate have ultimately been swallowed by the House. That becomes more likely in the case of a divided Congress, with the Senate in Democratic hands.

Senate Democrats will also be a voice for the administration when Congress must pass bills to fund the government and raise the statutory borrowing limit. But Republicans, if they win control of the House, will almost certainly try to extract concessions, under the threat of government shutdowns or even a potentially disastrous debt default.

Republican leaders in the House have already indicated they will demand to undo a large funding increase for personnel at the Internal Revenue Service, which was included in the Inflation Reduction Act passed this year. They are also planning to press for more money for controls at the U.S. border with Mexico and to complete the border wall started by Mr. Trump.

For much of the midterm campaigns, Republicans and independent analysts saw G.O.P. control of the House as a foregone conclusion, given Mr. Biden’s unpopularity and the headwinds that economic uncertainty and inflation represented for Democratic candidates.

But control of the Senate appeared to be a seesaw battle. Those same political headwinds burdened Democratic candidates for the Senate, but weak Republican challengers, many of them endorsed or handpicked by Mr. Trump, gave Democrats a fighting chance in swing states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.

In the heated aftermath of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, which ended constitutional protections for abortion, Democrats thought they could bolster their 50-vote control by two or three seats. Then the pendulum seemed to swing late in the campaigns, and Republicans convinced themselves that the anger over abortion was waning. Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the leader of Senate Republicans’ political arm, said in late October that he saw a path to a 55-seat Republican majority, predicting that even Democratic states like Washington and Colorado were in play.

In the end, the field proved to be much smaller. Democrats were able to capture just one Republican seat, that of the retiring Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, which was won by the state’s lieutenant governor, John Fetterman. But, so far, Republicans have defeated no Democratic incumbents in Senate races. And only one Democratic incumbent, Mr. Warnock in Georgia, is left to possibly defeat.

“With Senator Cortez Masto’s victory, Democrats have accomplished a historic feat in defending our Senate majority against all odds and when the conventional wisdom said we have no business even being in the fight,” declared J.B. Poersch, the president of the Senate Majority PAC, the super PAC aligned with Democratic leadership. He said it had been 60 years since the party defended all of its seats in a midterm when it held control of Washington.

Deciding Senate control before Georgia’s runoff could affect the Warnock-Walker race. Voters on both sides may have less motivation to turn out with the stakes considerably lower. Democrats hope that will be particularly helpful to Mr. Warnock.

Mr. Walker’s campaign for Senate has been dogged by allegations of domestic violence and exaggerations of his résumé, and by accusations from two former girlfriends that he paid for them to have abortions. The last was especially problematic for a candidate who has been an unwavering opponent of abortion, even in cases of rape or incest.

Some Georgia voters appeared to have split their tickets between Mr. Warnock and the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, who easily won re-election on Tuesday. Some may have voted for Mr. Kemp and left the Senate slots blank.

Now, with Mr. Kemp not on the ballot and a Senate majority no longer in play, Democrats hope a significant number of Georgia Republicans will stay home on Dec. 6.

But the lower stakes could affect Democratic turnout as well, which would deprive Mr. Warnock of the claim that his victory carries weight beyond simple Senate control. In truth, however, 51 seats would have practical implications. Instead of evenly divided Senate committees, Democrats would have a numerical majority, which would help them issue subpoenas, research nominations and send legislation to a final vote without the interceding of the Senate Democratic leader.

With our Inside the Spurs NBA news tracker, we provide daily updates from the biggest headlines around the San Antonio Spurs and the league at large.

NOV 13 KYRIE DRAMA UPDATE

The Brooklyn Nets seem to have turned a corner lately, as they've won four of their last five games. Coincidentally, that turn has happened with star point guard Kyrie Irving being sidelined due to a team suspension stemming from him refusing to state that he doesn't hold any anti-Semitic beliefs.

According to Nets owner Joe Tsai, it looks like it could still be a while before Irving returns, but that might be a bad thing for Brooklyn based on how it has played with his distractions being gone.

""He still has work to do,"" Tsai told the New York Post. ""He has to show people he's sorry. What’s important — and what people miss — is he only apologized after he was suspended.”

AUG 20 RODMAN TO RUSSIA? As the U.S. government works to bring home detained WNBA star Brittney Griner, a former NBA star wants to travel to Russia to help.

Dallas native Dennis Rodman announced this weekend he plans to get involved.

“I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,” Rodman said. “I’m trying to go this week.”

The Basketball Hall of Famer, who gained fame as a champion with the Chicago Bulls and also played briefly for the Dallas Mavs, told NBC News of his intention to travel to Russia in the near future to seek Griner’s release.

Former Baylor star Griner, 31, was sentenced to nine years in prison in Russia earlier this month after facing drug charges following her arrest at a Moscow airport in February for possessing hashish oil in her luggage.

AUG 20 SPURS AFFECT LEBRON’S EXTENSION?

LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers recently reached an agreement on a two-year, $97.1 million contract extension. It took some time for the deal to be reached and signed following him becoming eligible to negotiate.

According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, James was simply not interested in his options when it came to potential teams to sign with next summer.

“For LeBron James, he looked at the free agency landscape next summer, who might have cap space, and there was nothing that interested him enough, I’m told, to keep that option open and go into the season on an expiring contract.”

The San Antonio Spurs are among the teams set to hold massive salary cap space next offseason. After moving on from Dejounte Murray to undergo a long-term rebuild, it shouldn't be a surprise that James wasn't intrigued.

AUG 20 NBA STARS BACK IN SEATTLE

It's been 14 years since the basketball-loving city of Seattle lost its SuperSonics. If the NBA ever decides to expand again, Seattle could be in the running for getting a team again, but for now, the city has to take whatever form of NBA action it can get until that time comes.

On Saturday night, a handful of NBA stars and potential future stars are set to play in Jamal Crawford's pro-am league, ""The Crawsover."" The list of players who will be in attendance include: LeBron James, Jayson Tatum, Dejounte Murray, Paolo Banchero, Chet Holmgren, Isaiah Thomas, Tari Eason and MarJon Beauchamp.

The game will tip off at 7:30pm CT and can be watched on the NBA App and NBA.com.

AUG 13 NBA SCHEDULE LEAKS

Although the full NBA schedule won't be released until next week, a few of the most important matchups have already started to leak out. On Friday, NBA reporter Marc Stein reported that Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks are set to take on LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 25.

""The first draft of next season's NBA schedule has Lakers at Dallas/LeBron at Luka on Christmas Day, league sources tell me,"" Stein tweeted. ""Changes are still possible before the full schedule officially drops next week but Christmas games usually hold.""

On Saturday, The Athletic's Shams Charania followed that up by announcing that the defending champion Golden State Warriors opening night game on Oct. 18, which will also be when they receive their rings and raise their championship banner, will be against James and the Lakers."
18,https://www.infowars.com/posts/ye-says-his-mother-was-sacrificed-by-hollywood-elite-they-want-to-monetize-traumatize/,"Rapper and fashion mogul Ye claimed the untimely death of his mother was no accident, but the result of a “sacrifice” made by the Hollywood elite.

In an interview with “The Shade Room” earlier this week, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, explained that the Hollywood machine is furious that they can’t keep him on the official script.

“They can’t control me,” he stated from his vehicle. “They can control Shaq. They can control Charles Barkley. They can control LeBron James. They can control JAY-Z and Beyoncé. But they can’t control me. You see it ain’t no name I won’t name. It’s up.”

Ye then made a startling claim that his mother was “sacrificed” by the Hollywood elite before naming other celebrities who may have been victims of a similar conspiracy.

“My mama ain’t here,” Ye stated. “My mama was sacrificed. Michael Jordan, what about him? His daddy, right? Bill Cosby, his son. Dr. Dre, his son. Out in Hollywood, a lot of people come up missing. It feels like it might be a lot of that, in order to control, traumatize.”

“They want to monetize and traumatize,” he continued, “And God love me, they hit me, Gap, Adidas, they took all that away. Still, Forbes, who hates me, right, had to write, net worth $400 million. Jesus is king. God loves me.”

Ye’s mother Donda West had reportedly passed away from heart disease while suffering “multiple post-operative factors” after plastic surgery in 2008.

Ye’s shocking interview is going viral on social media despite it being deleted from the Shade Room’s website and Instagram page.

This comes after Ye revealed a text message from his personal trainer Harley Pasternak threatening to “institutionalize” and forcibly drug him if he continued talking about “crazy stuff.”

“I’m going to help you one of a couple ways,” Pasternak wrote. “First, you and I sit down and have an loving and open conversation, but you don’t use cuss words, and everything that is discussed is based in fact, and not some crazy stuff that dumb friend of yours told you, or you saw in a tweet.”

“Second option, I have you institutionalized again where they medicate the crap out of you and you go back to Zombieland forever. Play date with the kids just won’t be the same.”

Ye has been making controversial statements in recent weeks suggesting a disproportionate influence of Jewish interests in the entertainment industry, resulting in numerous corporations severing ties with the rapper and fashion mogul.

The Anti-Defamation League has even organized a global corporate boycott against Twitter for not doing enough to censor Ye’s speech on the platform.

The fact these videos are being removed across the internet only highlights Ye’s point that he’s being deliberately silenced for speaking his mind.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

FM: Where is your favorite place that you’ve lived? Chicago, D.C., Cambridge?

CRS: Massachusetts. Of all the places I’ve lived, my favorite is Concord, Massachusetts, And of all the places I’ve worked, my favorite is Cambridge, Massachusetts.

FM: Why is that?

CRS: Cambridge just has a combination of energy and sense, meaning there’s a lot of intellectual energy, people are full of ideas. There are nice restaurants, it isn’t too crowded, it’s pleasant, and also you can find what you need there. I’ve lived in New York, which is amazing, but a little overwhelming to me. And I’ve lived in Chicago, which I really like, but Cambridge is better than any workplace I’ve lived.

FM: At Harvard, you’re not just a professor at the Law School — you also teach a Gen Ed, “Making Change When Change Is Hard.” What inspired you to teach that course? And why do you enjoy the opportunity to teach undergrads?

CRS: It grew out of a course that my wife and I created a few years ago. We had come out of the government; she was in the area of foreign policy, and I was in the area of domestic policy. And we thought that we had learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t to make change, and that there would both be general lessons from particular events and also there might be enduring lessons from events in the last 40 years, some of which we were privileged to be observers of or participants in. We both thought that undergraduates have brilliance, of course, because it’s Harvard, but also they have a kind of openness to ideas of their own that maybe are completely original. When you’re in grad school you might be a little more careful, which is amazing and fantastic. But there’s something fantastic about people who are willing to think something completely fresh.

FM: You teach Gen Eds with large lecture halls of undergraduates, but I know that you’ve also appeared to testify before congressional committees quite a few times. What’s scarier: facing a crowd of undergraduates asking you questions or a panel of Congresspeople?

CRS: Well, what’s scary is playing for Harvard Squash for the national title. That’s scary. Or what’s scary is — right now I’m faculty fellow to the squash teams — getting on the court with someone on the men’s or women’s teams. Those are scary things. Teaching a large class is, to me, exciting, and testifying is a privilege. Testifying as an academic really isn’t scary at all. It’s an opportunity, and you want to be helpful, and it’s not a scary thing. If you’re testifying as a public official, you’re representing the administration for which you work, and you want to make sure that you don’t cast anything in a bad light.

FM: When did your love for squash come about? And how long have you been playing it exactly?

CRS: Well, on my first day on the planet, my dad took me to a squash court and had me watch the finals of a local tournament. And I was crying — you know, I was just out of the womb, so I was crying a lot. But as soon as I heard the bounce of the ball, I started to calm down. And even though I was only one day old, I smiled, which was very unusual. Okay, that’s all made up. None of that is true. [laughs] I started to play squash at Middlesex School in Concord, and I started to play regularly in eighth grade. And I just loved it. I love the fact that it was fast and that there were lots of decisions to be made in a hurry. It was love at first sight.

FM: Do you frequently attend Harvard squash games?

CRS: I have, through the years. In my current capacity, my family’s in Washington, D.C., so I commute back and forth. I do get down there these days, at least once a week. And I see that the team at Harvard has fantastic tradition and squash. They’ve won national titles on multiple occasions, both on the women’s side and the men’s side. I saw them very recently, and they look terrific.

FM: Going back to your Gen Ed, “Making Change When Change Is Hard,” any advice on what could possibly need to be changed at Harvard?

CRS: Well, I mean, most of my work is really about public policy. So I work on health and safety issues, I work on environmental issues, and higher education isn’t something that I’ve taught or studied aside from being lucky enough to be part of an institution of higher education. My observation of those parts of Harvard that I’m privileged to see is just very favorable. The students are amazing, the faculty is tremendous, the range and diversity of opportunities for students is out of sight. From what I’m observing in my classes and just as I walk around Cambridge, it’s a tremendous institution. [dog barks in the background] And my dog is very much in agreement with that.

FM: Dogs or cats?

CRS: Dogs. I honor cats and their existence, and I wish them well, but dogs have captured my heart. You’re hearing two of them.

FM: What are their names?

Advertisement

CRS: They’re Labrador Retrievers, and one is Snow and [the other is] Finley. And you can hear them being fed because I take orders from them and they are very insistent that I do my job, which is to feed them.

FM: That is definitely the priority. So I know that you have lived in quite a few big baseball cities. Boston, Massachusetts is one of them. Are you a fan of any team?

CRS: I have been all my life a big Red Sox fan. But the current Red Sox I’ve followed with less intensity than past Red Sox. I have a deep emotional commitment to the Red Sox, but I don’t have a deep understanding of the 2022 season.

FM: This past summer, the Supreme Court made the decision on Dobbs, overturning Roe. They are currently hearing the case on race-conscious admissions, and that has the strong likelihood of being overturned as well this coming summer. What would you say to young people who have become a bit disillusioned with the law, the courts? Why do we still need to study them and respect them?

CRS: The rule of law is fundamental to a free society. The law ensures background conditions for freedom from violence, for free speech, for freedom of religion, for an ability to get from one place to another without people putting you behind some bars unless you’ve done something that warrants that. And the law is an instrument that can be used for great good and is being used for great good every day. It’s being used today to protect the environment, to protect people’s personhoods against people who want to hurt them or take something from them. It’s being used today to help keep the water clean. It’s being used today to help keep workers safer than they would otherwise be. The precondition for much of what we take for granted, so the fact that Harvard students are able to have various things that, in the arc of human history, are great, in terms of opportunities, liberties, and resources — the law has everything to do with all of those things. So if one doesn’t like the direction of the Supreme Court of the United States, the law allows you to say that, to explain to the Supreme Court itself why you think it’s gone in the wrong direction, of course, through lawyers, but also through The Crimson or through newspapers. And then the law is essential to study so we can maintain its best features and improve on those features that aren’t so good. There are a lot of people who are celebrating the new conservative Supreme Court, and it was sought by people in the political process for decades; they’ve gotten there. I’m not in agreement with the central directions of the current Supreme Court, but that should intensify our interest if you also are not in agreement and trying to make things better.

FM: I know that you clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, way back in 1979 to 1980. Are there any lessons from your time clerking for Justice Marshall that you believe can be used to inspire or give young people hope that not all is lost?

CRS: Well, keep in mind that young people have very diverse political views and very diverse views about the law. A lot of young people are enthusiastic about the conservative direction of the court. So for them, what we’re seeing now is hopeful, and the liberal court of the 1960s and 1970s is both ancient history and worrisome. For young people who think that the current direction is not a good one, Marshall thought that you use the best arguments you have. And sometimes you’re going to lose, especially with people who are not inclined to agree with you. But you use the best arguments you have, and you win sometimes. Marshall, on a conservative court, won a lot. Not as much as he would have wanted. But he won a lot on civil rights issues and free speech issues, issues involving sex discrimination. He was in dissent frequently, but it may be the fact that he was in dissent was noticed by the majority and led them to greater caution than we would have otherwise seen. That’s probably true. So I think the thing to think, if you don’t like the direction of the court, is that in every 10-year period, the court switches significantly. And whether the court is going to switch in 2032 from where it is now depends on a lot of things, including what kind of arguments people make. It was a quite conservative court that said the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. And there we were, and the arguments seemed to the majority to be convincing.

FM: I know that you were an undergrad at Harvard who played squash, but what I only recently learned was that you were also a member of a certain semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization, otherwise known as the Lampoon. Did you enjoy your time on the Harvard Lampoon?

CRS: Since 1876 or something, Harvard has been blessed to have a terrific publication that is both journalism and humor. It’s news and sports. It’s technology, it’s music. It’s the breeding ground for the journalists who have defined American journalism. And the fact that Harvard’s only had one outlet has been okay, because the outlet is so spectacular. The fact that Harvard has had so many opportunities with respect to sports and so many courses you can take and majors, and the fact that it has only had one publication for all these years — that is the Lampoon, that’s okay because the Lampoon is so great. If you want to do interviews, or if you want to do stories on politics, or if you want to do something about Taylor Swift, or if you want to do something about political campaigns — the Lampoon is where everyone goes. So its universality, I think, is why it redeems its uniqueness at Harvard. Other universities, they have a humor magazine plus a newspaper, maybe a daily newspaper. Harvard just has the Lampoon, but —

FM: Professor Sunstein, this Q&A is going to become unpublishable!

Advertisement

CRS: Okay, so, The Crimson is magnificent, needless to say —

FM: Okay, now we can run the piece.

CRS: There is the Lampoon and The Crimson, like LeBron James and Michael Jordan, and they’re both really good. And which is better? They’re different. The Lampoon ... it’s complicated, isn’t it? Humor is complicated. When I was there, there were people of unbelievable talent who became really famous in the world in which they wrote — not famous like Taylor Swift is famous — but famous in the worlds in which they wrote. And they did that because they were so talented, so this is what they ended up doing for their lives. And they were really great at humor. When I pick up the Lampoon now — which is every morning and every night, I basically spend focusing on the Lampoon. And Christmas. My family, we all just read the Lampoon — it’s good, it’s funny.

FM: You never considered a career as a comedian? Were you always set on being a law professor?

CRS: I appreciate that, but I did not.

20,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/35004915/miami-heat-cut-ties-bankrupt-ftx-rename-home-arena,"Miami-Dade County and the Miami Heat are ending their arena naming rights deal with bankrupt cryptocurrency firm FTX.

The county, which owns the arena, signed a 19-year, $135 million deal for the bayfront Heat homecourt's name in 2021. After an initial balloon payment of $14 million, FTX was scheduled to make a $5.5 million payment in January.

The arena will still technically be referred to as FTX Arena for Saturday's game between the Heat and Charlotte Hornets, but signage and the name will soon come down.

""The reports about FTX and its affiliates are extremely disappointing,"" the county and team said in a joint statement. ""Miami-Dade County and the Miami HEAT are immediately taking action to terminate our business relationships with FTX. We will be working together to find a new naming rights partner for the arena.""

FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday after a steep fall in crypto prices left the company unable to cover accounts as customers rushed to withdraw funds.

The deal in Miami was one of a number of sports marketing deals FTX had signed over the past few years, including sponsorship deals with the Golden State Warriors and Washington Wizards. Among top athletes who had FTX deals included Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, Warriors guard Stephen Curry and tennis star Naomi Osaka.

FTX also entered into a deal with Mercedes for Formula One racing and a sponsorship deal with Major League Baseball, whose umpires wear the company's logo. Earlier Friday, Mercedes said it would immediately remove FTX logos from its Formula One cars.

The Heat's home was known as American Airlines Arena from its opening in 1999 until last season.

The team was to receive $2 million a year as part of the naming rights deal with FTX. Most of the rest -- roughly $90 million over the lifetime of the agreement -- was to be paid to the county, the vast majority of it earmarked toward fighting gun violence and poverty.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."
21,https://news.yahoo.com/ftx-ceo-john-ray-confirms-190456555.html,"Crypto exchange FTX’s new CEO, John Ray, took to Twitter Saturday to confirm that FTX, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday and its U.S. subsidiary, FTX US, were hacked last night in an attack that drained hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto out of the exchanges’ wallets.

In a statement issued via Ryne Miller, FTX’s general counsel, on Twitter, Ray said FTX US and FTX.com “continue to make every effort to secure all assets, wherever located.”

After the hack began around 10 p.m. EST on Friday night, wallets appearing to belong to FTX began moving assets, which Miller said was the exchange taking “precautionary steps…to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.”

Ray confirmed Miller’s statement, adding that FTX is “in the process of removing trading and withdrawal functionality and moving as many digital assets as can be identified to a new cold wallet custodian.”

According to Ray, the company’s executives have been “in contact with, and are coordinating with law enforcement and relevant regulators” following the hack."
22,https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-11-12-the-fall-of-the-crypto-cabal-ftx-was-a-massive-money-laundering-slush-fund-for-democrats.html,"(Natural News) There’s yet more bombshell breaking news today in the crypto space. First, as we have outlined below in today’s Situation Update podcast, the takedown of FTX by Binance was a strategic blow to the “crypto cabal” run by globalists and Dems who set up FTX as a money laundering slush fund to finance Democrat election campaigns (and who knows what else).

Sam Bankman-Fried, the now discredited CEO of FTX (which declared bankruptcy on Friday), had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Dem candidates in the mid-term elections (including John Fetterman who narrowly “won” over Oz). As CNBC.com reported earlier this year, “Crypto billionaire says he could spend a record-breaking $1 billion in 2024 election.”

Through FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried was the second largest donor to Democrat candidates this year, only behind George Soros in terms of total dollars donated.

FTX was the brainchild of not just Sam Bankman-Fried, but his circle of close associates, all of whom have ties to East Coast academia and all the deep state connections that go along with that. (We shall not report more on that right here, but you can dig and see for yourself.)

Binance, on the other hand, run by Chinese-Canadian CEO “CZ” (ChangPeng Zhao), was a rival of FTX that was routinely targeted by globalist media (Reuters, Forbes, etc.) in an effort to destroy Binance in an effort to make FTX the dominant player in the crypto exchange space. This would have put FTX in a position to generate a billion dollars in donations every election cycle in the USA, out-funding Republican donors by a long shot.

Binance believes in freedom and liberty, while FTX represented corruption, globalism and rigged elections

Binance’s CZ, however, appears to be a mature, meticulous and libertarian-minded individual who, despite his being born in communist China, seems to support libertarian concepts in money, crypto and the freedom to transact. Furthermore, CZ recently stated he would like to work with Elon Musk on the new Twitter, positioning Binance as the default crypto transaction system on the network, fully knowing that Twitter is shifting toward allowing free speech of conservatives, Christians and pro-liberty individuals. CZ has published his a document outlining his principles here, and you can see that he is a mature, high-IQ individual who does not take insane risks in the crypto space.

Furthermore, while FTX’s donations went to Democrats, Binance focused donations on humanitarian efforts in Wuhan and Ukraine (among others), focusing on bringing food, medical supplies and emergency gear to the people, regardless of their politics.

CZ is reported to be joining the board of Twitter as a “favor” to Tesla (Elon). Furthermore, CZ understands that the freedom to speak is essential to economic freedom and prosperity, as reported by Cointelegraph.com:

“Free speech is a prerequisite for having freedom of money, which we are building for,” said CZ, highlighting the importance of Twitter as a platform to voice opinions.

Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s decision to invest $500 million in the social media site took the limelight.

The second reason for the fund injection is related to Binance’s support for entrepreneurs. In CZ’s words, “With Elon at the helm, we believe Twitter will continue to grow and become an impactful platform for everyone.”

While globalists were trying to tear down Binance, CZ struck back against the journo-terrorists, saying that Reuters was endangering the lives of his children. This was reported by Protos.com at this link. CZ clearly understands, in other words, how dangerous the global media cabal has become. These so-called “journo-terrorists” at Reuters, AP, NYC, MSNBC, etc., are all about destroying freedom, annihilating the human race with bioweapons and vaccines, and eliminating all competition to their power monopolies.

CZ apparently stands against all that. Which means that Binance is the anti-globalist platform for crypto, while FTX represented the corrupt, money-laundering globalist cabal. Binance is the adult in the room, while FTX is the corrupt cabal, run by immature children who follow no ethics whatsoever.

The fall of FTX is one huge accomplishment in the deconstruction of the globalist system. Binance and CZ are to be congratulated for this achievement, which wasn’t even that difficult (it only took two tweets from CZ to bring down the entire FTX house of cards).

Personally, this whole thing gives me a new level of appreciation for Binance.

BREAKING: FTX apparent “self-hack” now underway, with hundreds of millions looted

At this moment, an apparent “self-hack” is taking place on FTX (including FTX US) which is draining hundreds of millions of dollars from user accounts. The FTX app has self-updated and transformed into a Trojan horse that is draining user accounts. The FTX website has become malware that installs trojans onto users’ computers.

The astonishing chaos now taking place is being widely reported by CNBC.com (reporting on a “secret back door” that allowed Sam Bankman to transfer billions), Coindesk.com, ZeroHedge.com, Cointelegraph and others. Via Coindesk:

‘FTX Has Been Hacked’: Crypto Disaster Worsens as Exchange Sees Mysterious Outflows Exceeding $600M

FTX officials appeared to confirm rumors of a hack on Telegram, instructing users to delete FTX apps and avoid its website.

The collapse of FTX, already one of the most spectacular disasters in financial history, worsened as hundreds of millions of dollars were drained from the cryptocurrency exchange hours after it filed for bankruptcy.

More than $600 million was siphoned from FTX’s crypto wallets late Friday. Soon after, FTX stated in its official Telegram channel that it had been compromised, instructing users not to install any new upgrades and to delete all FTX apps.

“FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don’t go on FTX site as it might download Trojans,” wrote an account administrator in the FTX Support Telegram chat. The message was pinned by FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller.

The buzz across the ‘net centers around suspicion that Sam Bankman and/or his own current or former employees engineered this “hack” and have drained user funds as they prepare to flee authorities and try to disappear.

Some analysts suspect this entire thing has been a setup to try to destroy the credibility of all crypto so that the SEC can justify an aggressive crackdown on the crypto ecosystem. Either way, Sam Bankman-Fried is a crook, and his $32 billion empire / Democrats slush fund just got vaporized in a matter of days by Binance and CZ.

Get more details in today’s Situation Update podcast here:

– FTX was a massive digital SLUSH FUND for Democrats

– Money was created out of nothing via FTT (tokens), then sold off to victims of the scam

– Millions went to Fetterman and other Dems to sway mid-term elections

– Sam Bankman-Fried had pledged $1 billion to Dems by 2024

– Globalist media outlets like Reuters and Forbes then attacked rival Binance

– Binance CEO CZ needed just two tweets to bring down the FTX fraud

– Binance is more libertarian and wants to coexist on Twitter with Elon Musk and free speech

– Binance doesn’t pilfer user deposits / funds and make crazy bets (like FTX did)

– We are watching the collapse of dollar hegemony

– BRICS+ nations will shortly launch a new global reserve currency backed by commodities

– Hubs like Binance will likely allow Americans to buy BRICS+ currencies via stablecoins

– This would give Americans a way to SAVE money without losing to dollar devaluation

– The future of world trade will rest on honest money, backed by real commodities

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) – FTX was engulfed in more chaos on Saturday when the crypto exchange said it had detected unauthorized access and analysts said hundreds of millions of dollars of assets had been moved from the platform in “suspicious circumstances”.

FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday, one of the highest profile crypto blowups, after traders rushed to withdraw $6 billion from the platform in just 72 hours and rival exchange Binance abandoned a proposed rescue deal.

FTX Chief Executive John J. Ray III said on Saturday that the company was working with law enforcement and regulators to mitigate the problem, and was making “every effort to secure all assets, wherever located.”

“Among other things, we are in the process of removing trading and withdrawal functionality,” he said.

The exchange’s dramatic fall from grace has seen its 30-year-old founder Sam Bankman-Fried, known for his shorts and T-shirt attire, morph from being the poster child of crypto’s successes to the protagonist of the industry’s biggest crash.

Bankman-Fried, who lives in the Bahamas, has also been the subject of speculation about his whereabouts and he denied rumors on Twitter that he had flown to South America. When asked by Reuters whether he had flown to Argentina, he responded in a text message: “Nope”. He told Reuters he was in the Bahamas.

The turmoil at FTX has seen at least $1 billion of customer funds vanish from the platform, sources told Reuters on Friday. Bankman-Fried had transferred $10 billion of customer funds to his trading company, Alameda Research, the sources said.

New problems emerged on Saturday when FTX’s U.S. general counsel Ryne Miller said in a Twitter post that the firm’s digital assets were being moved into so-called cold storage “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions.”

Cold storage refers to crypto wallets that are not connected to the internet to guard against hackers.

Blockchain analytics firm Nansen said it saw $659 million in outflows from FTX International and FTX U.S. in the last 24 hours.

A separate blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said that around $515 million worth of cryptoassets were “suspected to have been stolen,” while $186 million were likely moved into secure storage by FTX.

Crypto exchange Kraken said: “We can confirm our team is aware of the identity of the account associated with the ongoing FTX hack, and we are committed to working with law enforcement to ensure they have everything they need to sufficiently investigate this matter.”

FTX was not immediately available for comment about the outflows or Kraken’s statement.

In its bankruptcy petition, FTX Trading said it has $10 billion to $50 billion in assets, $10 billion to $50 billion in liabilities, and more than 100,000 creditors. Ray, a restructuring expert, was appointed to take over as CEO.

A document that Bankman-Fried shared with investors on Thursday and was reviewed by Reuters showed FTX had $13.86 billion in liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets. However, only $900 million of those assets were liquid, leading to the cash crunch that ended with the company filing for bankruptcy.

The collapse shocked investors and prompted fresh calls to regulate the cryptoasset sector, which has seen losses stack up this year as cryptocurrency prices collapsed.

“Things will continue to simmer after the FTX crash,” said Alan Wong, operations manager of Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange.

“With a gap of $8 billion between liabilities and assets, when FTX is insolvent, it will trigger a domino effect, which will lead to a series of investors related to FTX going bankrupt or being forced to sell assets.”

Crypto market maker Jump said on Twitter late on Saturday that it had an undisclosed exposure to FTX, adding that the firm remains well capitalized.

MARKET FALLOUT

Since its founding in 2019, FTX had raised more than $2 billion from top investors including Sequoia, SoftBank, BlackRock and Temasek. In January, FTX had raised $400 million from investors at a $32 billion valuation.

SoftBank and Sequoia Capital said they were marking their investments in FTX down to zero.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc will also write off the investment its ventures arm made in FTX in 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Bitcoin fell below $16,000 for the first time since 2020 after Binance abandoned its rescue deal for FTX on Wednesday.

On Saturday it was trading around $16,800, down by more than 75% from the all-time high of $69,000 it reached in November last year.

FTX’s token FTT plunged by around 91% this week. Shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms have also declined.

“We believe cryptocurrency markets remain too small and too siloed to cause contagion in financial markets, with an $890 billion market cap in comparison to U.S. equity’s $41 trillion,” Citi analysts wrote.

“Over four years, FTX raised $1.8 billion from venture capital and pension funds. This is the primary way financial markets could suffer, as it may have further minor implications for portfolio shocks in a volatile macro regime.”

The U.S. securities regulator is investigating FTX.com’s handling of customer funds, as well its crypto-lending activities, a source with knowledge of the inquiry said.

Hedge fund Galois Capital had half its assets trapped on FTX, the Financial Times reported on Saturday, citing a letter from co-founder Kevin Zhou to investors and estimating the amount to be around $100 million.

Let’s review. Democrat marxists give unaccounted billions to Ukraine. Ukraine puts unaccounted billions into FTX. The “Founder” of FTX and buddies becomes the largest donors to the democrat marxist party. Implodes immediately after massive fraud in the midterms. Zero news in the legacy and big tech media.

After spending $180,000 USD worth of Ethereum on a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, Stephen Curry has announced that he will serve as Global Brand Ambassador and shareholder for the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX.

“I’m excited to partner with a company that demystifies the crypto space and eliminates the intimidation factor for first-time users,” said Curry in a statement. “FTX is likeminded when it comes to giving back to the community in meaningful ways and I can’t wait to see what we can achieve together.”

25,https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/black-panther-wakanda-forever-producer-reveals-a-key-part-of-the-credit-scene-predated-chadwick-bosemans-passing/,"Naturally, there be spoilers ahoy for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever from here on out.

The opening and closing scenes of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever have been leaving patrons bawling in the aisles, with the bookending moments of the blockbuster Marvel Cinematic Universe sequel paying a moving tribute to Chadwick Boseman.

The beginning sees the nation of Wakanda hold a funeral for its dearly departed king, while the mid-credits stinger reveals that he and Nakia had a child that’s been squirreled away in Haiti his entire life in order to avoid the constant pressure of being next in line to the throne.

It’s a moving moment, one that could be paid of in a major way should Black Panther 3 hypothetically feature a time jump that would see Toussaint/T’Challa heading home to take his rightful place, which would neatly bookend the entire saga by having the same bloodline sitting on the most important seat.

You may have thought that the scene was added as a way to pay tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, but producer Nate Moore revealed in an interview with Collider that the son of T’Challa was part of a draft that existed before the actor’s untimely death when asked how it came together.

“Pretty early on. That was always the end of the movie pretty, much since Chad’s passing. I think the first draft we got had that in there, and the notion of the character introduced in that scene actually predated Chad’s passing, to be quite honest. We always like the idea that… Yeah. But it was repurposed thematically once Chad passed, and hopefully feels like renewal after a time of adversity.”

It sounds as though the plan was always for T’Challa and Nakia to become parents, but it hits dramatically harder knowing that we’ll never see Boseman on our screens again. As it stands, it’s a near-perfect conclusion to Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which ends with a ray of light after focusing on so much darkness among the cast of characters."

The film about the technologically-advanced fictional African country was filmed in Georgia for the most part, and fans seem to be flocking to the theater to watch the film. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film had one of the biggest opening days of all time, earning $84 million in gross sales on Friday. The film is expected to gross between $174 million to $184 million over the weekend. The sequel is also earning rave reviews. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever earned an A from CinemaScore and is expected to open with $325 million in box office sales worldwide.

The sequel demolished the record for a November opening, soaring past the previous high-water mark of $158 million set by 2013′s “Hunger Games: Catching Fire.” Globally, the superhero adventure netted a monstrously good $330 million with $150 million of that figure coming from 55 overseas markets.

Its success has a bittersweet undercurrent. That's because the filmmakers behind the sequel faced a shocking off-screen tragedy before production even commenced when Chadwick Boseman, the actor who had given 2018's ""Black Panther"" so much of its soul, died in 2020 of cancer. He was only 43 years old. In response, Ryan Coogler, the film's director and co-writer, re-fashioned ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" into a tribute for the late actor. In the movie, the kingdom of Wakanda is grappling with the death of King T'Challa -- an art imitates life situation that gave the film greater emotional resonance.

Critics praised Coogler's deft handling of the difficult material, with Variety's Owen Gleiberman writing, ""'Wakanda Forever' has a slow-burn emotional suspense. Once the film starts to gather steam, it doesn't let up.""

There were other hurdles facing ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" The $250 million production was shot in the midst of COVID and also had to contend with an injury to one of its stars, Letitia Wright, that required filming to be suspended. That's to say nothing of the dramatically altered theatrical landscape that it now must navigate. When ""Black Panther"" hit screens four years ago, China and Russia were still major film markets. But geo-political tensions have made China more inaccessible to Hollywood fare and Russia's invasion of Ukraine means that studio films no longer screen in the country. So, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" will be a global powerhouse, but it probably won't hit the $1.4 billion mark that its predecessor achieved (few, if any, films can, these days).

Most films steered clear of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" However, Steven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical ""The Fabelmans"" opened in limited release, premiering in four theaters in New York City and Los Angeles and earning a solid $160,000 for an average of $40,000 per-screen. It faces its real test when it goes wide on Nov. 23. The movie, a portrait of the guy who grew up to give us ""Jurassic Park"" as a young man, has been generating awards heat, but it faces commercial headwinds. Movies like ""Tár,"" ""Till,"" ""Armageddon Time"" and ""Triangle of Sadness"" are beloved by critics, but have struggled at the box office. Adult audiences, it seems, have yet to come back to cinemas in force after the pandemic. In fact, Spielberg's most recent effort, 2021's ""West Side Story,"" bombed despite its glowing reviews. Will ""The Fabelmans,"" a tender-hearted family saga, be the thing that gets older crowds back into multiplexes? The $40 million drama does seem to be connecting with those who see it. It earned an A CinemaScore rating, which bodes well for word-of-mouth.

""Black Adam,"" a comic book adventure from Warner Bros. and DC, nabbed second place at the domestic box office, grossing $8.6 million to push its domestic haul to $151.1 million. Universal's ""Ticket to Paradise,"" a rom-com with Julia Roberts and George Clooney, netted $6.1 million for a third place finish. That brings its stateside total to $56.5 million. Sony's ""Lyle, Lyle Crocodile"" came in fourth with $3.2 million. It has grossed $40.8 million since opening last month.

Paramount's low-budget horror hit, ""Smile,"" rounded out the top five with $2.3 million. The film, which cost a modest $17 million to make (or half-a-""Fabelmans""), has earned an impressive $102.8 million domestically. That kind of result should leave the studio flashing its pearly whites.

28,https://www.howtogeek.com/847749/4-exciting-space-launches-you-can-watch-soon/,"Even though humans have been pushing satellites and other people into space for over 50 years now, space travel isn’t any less exciting. Here are a few upcoming launches you should watch, and why they matter.

Artemis 1: November 16, 2022

Artemis 1 might be the most important mission for NASA in at least the past decade. It’s the first full test of the Space Launch System, a massive multi-stage rocket intended to serve the same purpose as the Saturn V from the 1960s — sending humans to the Moon. Modified versions could be used to send heavy cargo into space (like parts for new space stations) or to take humans to Mars and beyond.

This initial mission is uncrewed (no people are in the ship), but the goal is to launch the empty Orion space capsule on a 280,000-mile trip to the Moon and back. If all goes well, Artemis II could take humans on the same trip. The current launch window opens on November 16, 2022 at 1:04 AM Eastern Time. Live coverage will be available on the NASA app, the agency’s website, and the NASA YouTube channel.

The launch has already been pushed back several times, due to technical problems and weather. The first launch window was set for August 29, 2022, but it was cancelled due to detected problems with cooling an engine. NASA tried again on September 3, but stopped due to a liquid hydrogen leak in the core stage, then the rocket was rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building as Hurricane Ian approached Florida. It’s now back on the launchpad, but there’s still a chance that Tropical Storm Nicole could change NASA’s plans again.

Cargo Dragon Launch: November 18, 2022

SpaceX has been flying cargo to the International Space Station for years, thanks to a contract with NASA, using the Dragon 1 and Dragon 2 spacecraft. The next “Cargo Dragon” mission is set for November 18, 2022.

Even though the Dragon capsule can carry people to the International Space Station — the first time was in 2020 — there won’t be any people on this mission. SpaceX CRS-26 Mission will be an uncrewed mission to resupply the space station, using a Cargo Dragon capsule and a Falcon 9 rocket. The payload includes a portable handheld microscope to improve health diagnosis in space, solar arrays for the station, an experiment with tomatoes, and more.

The current launch is targeted for November 18, and will take place at Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX will likely show a livestream on its YouTube channel, and the launch may also appear on the NASA app, the agency’s website, and the NASA YouTube channel.

Intuitive Machines Moon Payload: December 22, 2022

Another part of NASA’s plan for Moon missions is Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS for short. The program aims to have private companies (like SpaceX) launch cargo to the moon and/or conduct science missions on behalf of NASA.

Intuitive Machines of Houston, a space exploration company based in (you guessed it) Houston, Texas, is conducting the next mission in the CLPS program. It’s a Moon landing with four NASA payloads, which will run experiments on the lunar surface. One of the payloads is a small data relay satellite. The experiments will gather data for use in future crewed and uncrewed Moon missions.

The launch is currently scheduled for December 22, 2022, using a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Because SpaceX is handling the launch, there will likely be a livestream on SpaceX’s YouTube channel, or possibly a stream on the NASA YouTube channel.

Boeing Crew Flight Test: April 2023

SpaceX isn’t the only American company trying to carry people to space — Boeing has also been trying to make it happen. The company’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft looks a bit like the SpaceX Dragon and Apollo command module, but is slightly larger than both vehicles. Boeing and NASA already completed two space flights with no one onboard, but the next attempt will have a crew.

The first Boeing Crew Flight Test (CFT) is scheduled for sometime in April 2023, launched with an Atlas V rocket. NASA has selected Barry Eugene Wilmore and Sunita Williams as the crew, both of whom previously flew on Space Shuttle missions, with Michael Fincke as a backup. If all goes well, Starliner will fly to the International Space Station, then return to Earth in the same ship after a week.

NASA said on its website, “the CFT astronauts will live and work on the space station for about two weeks. Following a successful crewed flight, NASA will work to complete certification of the Starliner spacecraft and systems for regular crew rotation missions to the space station.”

April 2023 is a while away, but the launch will probably be broadcasted on the NASA app, the agency’s website, and the NASA YouTube channel.

CAPSTONE: Entering Orbit November 13, 2022

Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment, or CAPSTONE for short, is a small satellite about the size of a microwave oven. The rocket launch was back on July 4, 2022, so there’s no exciting upcoming livestream for this one — this is more of an honorary mention, since the satellite hasn’t reached its target yet.

CAPSTONE is taking an unusual path to the Moon that NASA calls Ballistic Lunar Transfer, or BLT for short — no relation to the sandwich, probably. NASA said in a blog post, “assisted by the Sun’s gravity, the spacecraft will reach a distance of 958,000 miles from Earth — more than three times the distance between Earth and the Moon — before being pulled back towards the Earth-Moon system.”

Play Video

CAPSTONE is unique because it will be the first spacecraft to enter a special elongated orbit around the Moon. That’s the same orbit NASA hopes to use for the proposed Gateway space station around the Moon, which makes CAPSTONE an important learning opportunity. In that special orbit, less fuel is required maintain orbit, which is important when the nearest fuel stop is hundreds of thousands of miles away.

Once it reaches lunar orbit, CAPSTONE’s job will be testing a technology called Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS), which is a bit like Google Maps for space travel. NASA said in another blog post, “CAPS will demonstrate innovative spacecraft-to-spacecraft navigation solutions that will allow future spacecraft to determine their location without having to rely exclusively on tracking from Earth.” The technology involves communicating directly with NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has orbited the Moon since 2009."

Example video title will go here for this video

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — NASA's moon rocket needs only minor repairs after enduring a hurricane at the pad and is on track for its first test flight next week, a top official said Friday.

“Right now, there’s nothing preventing us"" from attempting a launch on Wednesday, said NASA's Jim Free, an associate administrator.

The wind never exceeded the rocket’s design limits as Hurricane Nicole swept through Kennedy Space Center on Thursday, according to Free. But he acknowledged if the launch team had known in advance that a hurricane was going to hit, they likely would have kept the rocket indoors. The rocket was moved out to the pad late last week for its $4.1 billion demo mission.

Gusts reached 100 mph (160 kph) atop the launch tower, but were not nearly as strong farther down at the rocket. Computer models indicate there should be no strength or fatigue issues from the storm, even deep inside the rocket, Free noted.

NASA had been aiming for an early Monday launch, but put it on hold for two days because of the storm.

The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket, known as SLS for Space Launch System, is the most powerful ever built by NASA. A crew capsule atop the rocket, with three test dummies on board, will shoot for the moon — the first such flight in 50 years when Apollo astronauts last visited the moon.

NASA wants to test all the systems before putting astronauts on board in 2024 for a trip around the moon.

Two previous launch attempts, in late summer, were thwarted by fuel leaks. Hurricane Ian also forced a return to the hangar at the end of September."
30,https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/ndsu-grad-part-of-nasas-artemis-i-mission-to-get-back-to-the-moon,"FARGO — A North Dakota State University alum will play a role in the planned launch this week of Artemis I, a program to help NASA return to the moon.

In fact, Austin Decker has spent almost his entire career thus far working to support the Space Launch System or SLS rocket that will propel the Orion spacecraft on the mission.

Decker, 42, born and raised in Williston, is a 2004 mechanical engineering graduate of NDSU.

In his job at NASA, he leads the integrated vehicle loads team, tasked with calculating the primary structure loads on the rocket starting with liftoff.

The solid rocket motor goes from zero to 3 million pounds of thrust in a quarter second, he said, and four RS-25 engines add another 400,000 pounds of thrust.

“It’s a pretty dynamic event,” Decker said in an interview from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The launch window for Artemis 1 opens at 12:04 a.m. Central Standard Time on Wednesday, Nov. 16, at nearby Kennedy Space Center.

The launch was originally set for August, but a fuel line leak and other issues pushed it back.

Hurricane Ian in late September caused another major delay, with the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft having to be rolled back off the launch pad for protection.

A new date of Monday, Nov. 14 was set, but Tropical Storm Nicole intervened with little warning.

Fortunately, the rocket and spacecraft were able to stay put this time.

Now, it looks like all systems are a “go” for Wednesday.

“It can be a bit stressful, but when this actually goes it's definitely going to be worth it,” Decker said.

Decker’s team will continue to monitor vehicle loads throughout the mission, as the rocket flies through the atmosphere.

“You've got all the thrust forces acting on it. You've got aerodynamic drag as it pushes through the air, and you also have side forces,” he said.

The “uncrewed” Artemis I mission will travel 40,000 miles around the moon, farther than any spacecraft built for humans has gone before.

The main point is to test the spacecraft, maneuvering systems and heat shield to ensure it's safe for Artemis II, when astronauts will be on board, Decker said.

If all goes well this time, Artemis II will take off in late 2024 and Artemis III, involving a human lunar landing, is planned for late 2025.

NASA’s long-term goal is to establish a sustainable presence on the moon and prepare for missions to Mars.

Decker lives and works in Huntsville, Alabama, where NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center is located.

Marshall is the lead center, of sorts, on the SLS rocket, Decker said.

Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas is the lead on the Orion spacecraft and Kennedy Space Center in Florida manages all ground systems during launches.

While most of Decker’s time is spent on a computer doing analyses, putting his math and science skills to use, he did get hands-on time at the launch site on Friday, Nov. 11.

He was part of a team of engineers to inspect the rocket, which will launch from pad 39B.

If Artemis is able to launch during the two-hour window that opens early Wednesday morning, it would result in a splashdown on Sunday, Dec. 11.

People can watch the launch live on NASA's YouTube channel or on NASA TV, if they subscribe to it on their cable system.

Decker thinks the 2020s and 2030s will be the most exciting times in space exploration since the 1960s, and said NASA will continually be looking for the right people to do it.

He encourages any interested NDSU engineering students to look for NASA job openings.

“Space is for everyone,” he said."

When NASA's Dawn spacecraft began photographing Ceres, one big surprise emerged: the presence of a spectacularly and unusually bright spot at the bottom of Occator crater. As we got closer, we discovered it was a series of spots in the lowlands of the crater bed, and that there were other suspicious, smaller bright spots elsewhere on the surface.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla — An unmanned U.S. military space plane landed early Saturday after spending a record 908 days in orbit for its sixth mission and conducting science experiments.

The solar-powered vehicle, which looks like a miniature space shuttle, landed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Its previous mission lasted 780 days.

“Since the X-37B’s first launch in 2010, it has shattered records and provided our nation with an unrivaled capability to rapidly test and integrate new space technologies,” said Jim Chilton, a senior vice president for Boeing, its developer.

For the first time, the space plane hosted a service module that carried experiments for the Naval Research Laboratory, U.S. Air Force Academy and others. The module separated from the vehicle before de-orbiting to ensure a safe landing.

Among the experiments was a satellite dubbed the FalconSat-8 that was designed and built by academy cadets in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory. It was deployed in October 2021 and still remains in orbit.

Another experiment evaluated the effects of long-duration space exposure on seeds.

“This mission highlights the Space Force’s focus on collaboration in space exploration and expanding low-cost access to space for our partners, within and outside of the Department of the Air Force,” said Gen. Chance Saltzman, Chief of Space Operations."

The U.S. Space Force’s Boeing-built X-37B space plane today completed yet another record-setting mission, landing like an airplane at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida 908 days after it was launched.

This was the sixth mission in the hush-hush X-37B test program, and the first to fly with a ring-shaped service module on its tail. The service module, which was jettisoned before the reusable plane’s descent, accommodated an extra set of experimental payloads for NASA and the U.S. military. It’s built to be safely disposed of in the coming weeks.

Hours after the landing at 5:22 a.m. ET (2:22 a.m. PT), the Space Force declared the mission to be a success.

“The deliberate manner in which we conduct on-­orbit operations — to include the service module disposal — speaks to the United States’ commitment to safe and responsible space practices, particularly as the issue of growing orbital debris threatens to impact global space operations,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in a news release.

Past X-37B missions, dating back to 2010, were conducted under the auspices of the Air Force, and the space plane’s fuselage still bears “USAF” markings. This was the first mission carried out by the Space Force, which was created as a separate military branch within the Department of the Air Force in 2019.

This mission, launched on an Atlas 5 rocket in May 2020, bested the 780-day endurance record that was set for the X-37B program in 2019. It also carried a record number of hosted experiments.

The Space Force said one of the experments, the Naval Research Laboratory’s Photovoltaic Radiofrequency Antenna Module, successfully harnessed solar rays outside Earth’s atmosphere and aimed to transmit power to the ground in the form of microwave energy.

FalconSat-8, an experimental satellite developed by the U.S. Air Force Academy in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory, was successfully deployed a year ago and remains in orbit.

The payloads flown for NASA included an experiment designed to test how well different types of thermal coatings, printed electronic materials and radiation-shielding materials hold up to exposure in space. Another NASA experiment investigated the effects of long-duration space exposure on seeds.

“The X-37B continues to push the boundaries of experimentation, enabled by an elite government and industry team behind the scenes,” said Lt. Col. Joseph Fritschen, X-37B program director at the Department of the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office. “The ability to conduct on-orbit experiments and bring them home safely for in-depth analysis on the ground has proven valuable for the Department of the Air Force and scientific community.”

Jim Chilton, senior vice president of Boeing Space and Launch, also hailed the test flight’s completion. “Since the X-37B’s first launch in 2010, it has shattered records and provided our nation with an unrivaled capability to rapidly test and integrate new space technologies,” he said in a news release.

Neither Boeing nor the Space Force said if or when future X-37B flights might take place. The Pentagon is thought to have two X-37B orbital test vehicles in its fleet."

The launch is scheduled for Wednesday morning (UTC) and will send an uncrewed Orion spacecraft on a lunar flyby mission. While technically unmanned, “Commander Moonikin Campos” will be aboard with two other mannequins, ensuring the safety of the Orion astronaut spacesuit for future crewed missions.

Tuesday, November 15

The first mission this week will launch from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. A Long March 4C will take the third Yaogan satellite into orbit, where it will be used for optical remote sensing. Some of its jobs include territorial surveying, urban planning, land right confirmation, road network design, crop yield estimation, and disaster prevention and mitigation. This mission is set to launch at 1:20 a.m. UTC.

Wednesday, November 16

We have two launches on Wednesday, the first is NASA’s Artemis I mission taking off between 6:04 a.m. and 8:04 a.m. from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. As mentioned earlier, it will send mannequins in the Orion spacecraft on a lunar flyby mission, paving the way for humanity’s return to the lunar surface, later this decade. Aside from the primary objective, the mission will be carrying 10 CubeSats. The launch should be quite prominent, expect to see it on news cycles. You can also see a live feed now.

The final launch of the week is a Galactic Energy's Ceres 1 (GX-1) rocket that will orbit five satellites for the Jilin 1 constellation. This mission will also take off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, this time at 6:26 a.m. It’ll be an interesting launch, as we don’t usually see missions from Galactic Energy, a private Chinese space launch company.

Recap

The first launch we got last week was a Northrop Grumman Antares 230+ rocket carrying the CRS-18 Cygnus spacecraft, which went to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. The launch happened on November 7 and the cargo arrived on November 9. The Cygnus spacecraft was called S.S. Sally Ride after NASA astronaut Sally Ride.

On the 10th, United Launch Alliance (ULA) launched its Atlas V rocket carrying to Joint Polar Satellite System 2 (JPSS-2) along with an inflatable decelerator called LOFTID. Read last week’s TWIRL to learn more about this interesting mission.

You can see LOFTID’s splashdown below.

On the 11th, a Long March 6A carried the Yunhai-3 satellite into orbit where it will perform atmospheric and marine surveys, disaster prevention and reduction, and scientific experiments.

Earlier today, China launched a Long March 7 Y6 carrying Tianzhou-5, a cargo spacecraft on a mission to the Chinese Space Station.

Finally, SpaceX used a Falcon 9 to orbit the Galaxy 31 and Galaxy 32 comms satellites.

35,https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20221105/cdc-officials-want-flexibility-in-times-of-crisis,"Nov. 3, 2022 -- Government restrictions hinder the CDC from doing the best possible job in a time of crisis, current and former agency officials are saying.

They’re hoping to persuade Congress for greater flexibility and support. Despite its multibillion-dollar budget, the CDC is unauthorized to hire consultants in an urgent situation.

Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, told CNN that she will ask Congress for flexibility to do that kind of hiring in a crisis. Other federal agencies already have that kind of authority.

Walensky said she hopes to “move the needle” by using “real-time examples of how public health has been hurt because of our inability to take action” during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I want to be very clear that [we] are not asking for a blank-slate ability to release resources. What we’re saying is, in certain situations, we need to be nimble and act urgently in culturally sensitive ways that we don’t currently have the capacity to do,” Walensky said."

It was unacceptable, but we knew it would be over soon.

But detached-from-reality grandstanding has become a staple even when there’s not much of a challenge — or no challenge at all. Case in point: S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson’s assault on the CDC’s latest public health recommendation.

Columbia’s State newspaper reports that Mr. Wilson joined 11 other state attorneys general last month in warning the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would endanger the lives of children by adding the COVID vaccine to its list of recommended childhood immunizations. It’s bad enough that their medical logic is bankrupt: The closest they come to an argument that bears repeating is the claim that adding COVID to the list could push more parents to reject the whole list, which actually is true — if Mr. Wilson and his cohorts keep peddling their anti-vax narrative.

Unfortunately, this is just the latest evidence that Mr. Wilson has fallen in with the wrong crowd: a crowd of state attorneys general who don't understand what their job is — and isn't.

Attorneys general are the chief legal officials in their states, yet the group's legal argument is — well, there is no legal argument. The CDC issues recommendations — which the attorneys general themselves acknowledge have absolutely no force of law.

But some states might make the decision on their own to adopt those recommendations, Mr. Wilson and his co-authors whine in their Oct. 19 letter to the CDC. That is: Some states might adopt policies that Mr. Wilson and his pals don’t like. Which, not to put too fine a point on it, is none of their business.

It’s worth noting that the CDC also includes the annual flu shot on its list of recommended childhood vaccinations. Seven states require kids to get flu shots to attend day care, but South Carolina and 42 other states have somehow managed to resist what Mr. Wilson and his colleagues consider overwhelming political pressure to fall in lock-step behind CDC recommendations. Ditto the CDC’s recommended HPV vaccinations, which are required by three states and the District of Columbia but notably not required by South Carolina and 46 other states.

It’s also worth noting that Mr. Wilson’s letter was dated two days after DHEC — the agency that decides what immunizations are required in South Carolina — had reminded everyone in an announcement about childhood vaccinations that COVID-19 vaccinations are not required in our state. A DHEC spokesman told The State that Mr. Wilson had not checked with the agency before he signed the letter. If he had, public health officials probably could have informed him that even if they wanted to require the vaccines, there’s a state law that prohibits that.

All of this is to say that Mr. Wilson’s involvement in this little bit of performative art had nothing to do with his job, which is to protect South Carolina’s constitution, laws and legal prerogatives. Indeed, it’s hard to see this as anything other than whipping up COVID division and anti-Washington sentiment, even more dramatically than Gov. Henry McMaster did with his ridiculous TV ad that claimed South Carolina’s economy recovered quickly from the pandemic because he had the backbone to “stand up” to Washington — where no one had any authority to make our state do anything regarding COVID.

And the particular way Mr. Wilson is doing this — by trying to prevent experts from expressing an opinion he doesn’t like — is eerily reminiscent of efforts on the left to enforce woke orthodoxy.

We used to look forward to this week, when we could remind elected officials that the election is over, and it’s time to put away their Halloween costumes and go back to the important business of governing. We don’t have much hope for Mr. Wilson, whose behavior can’t be blamed on the election, since he was unopposed for reelection on Tuesday. But we would urge other elected officials to remember, now that their election is over, that their job is to govern, which requires tackling actual problems in their portfolio and winning debates based on the best arguments, not on shouting down the other side."

With bird flu outbreaks among flocks in the US devastating farmers and the poultry industry, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is raising the red flag that people who live or work with the animals need to be extra careful, as the country nears a record-breaking number of sick birds.

Since early 2022 when the outbreak began, more than 49 million birds in nearly all states (46) have either died because they were infected with bird flu, or were culled (killed) because they may have been exposed or infected, the CDC said in a Nov. 3 announcement. In 2015, a record 50.5 million birds died in a 21-state outbreak.

Though the health risk to the general public remains low, people who work with birds, or live with them as pets, should take extra precautions to ""avoid unprotected contact"" with any birds that look sick. This includes wearing personal protective equipment like rubber boots and a face mask if working with them, and washing your clothes and hands after handling birds.

As long as animals and humans live, work and gather around each other, there will be a risk of viruses mutating enough to make the jump from species to species. Fortunately, bird flu in humans so far has been rare (the current outbreak is limited to one human case in the US), in part because the virus doesn't spread that easily from animals to humans, or between humans. This is why risk of bird flu is considered higher for people who work directly with birds, such as poultry workers or even hunters.

Still, some ""sporadic"" human cases of bird flu in the US ""would not be surprising,"" given the number of birds that are sick as well as infections in people in other countries who've had exposure to avian influenza, the CDC said. And limiting bird flu exposure to humans decreases the ability of the virus to spread person-to-person, which would be a more serious public health threat.

Here's what to know about bird flu, or avian influenza.

What is the bird flu?

The bird flu, aka avian influenza, is the disease caused by infection with influenza type A viruses. These viruses can circulate among birds around the world and have infected humans in rare cases, mostly those who work directly with infected birds. If the viruses mutate enough, the public health fear is that they might make the jump to spread among humans. The bird flu was first detected and controlled in 1997, but it reemerged in 2003 and started spreading widely among birds.

The predominant bird flu virus in the world is H5N1, according to the CDC. Since 2003, more than 880 human cases of earlier strains of H5N1 have been reported in humans.

Influenza viruses that cause the bird flu are either ""low pathogenic"" or ""highly pathogenic."" Highly pathogenic bird flu can cause severe disease or death in poultry, and it's those cases that the US Department of Agriculture is reporting. Both low and highly pathogenic viruses have caused mild to severe disease in infected humans.

The World Health Organization reports four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D. Type A viruses, which occur in both humans and different kinds of animals, are the biggest threat to public health and can cause pandemics, the WHO says. The ""swine flu"" of 2009's pandemic was caused by a type A virus. Seasonal flu viruses in humans are caused by type A and type B viruses.

Is it deadly?

Though human cases remain rare, about half of previous H5N1 human infections have resulted in death, the CDC said. But, as the agency noted in its April statement on the human case of bird flu, the current H5N1 appears different than earlier strains. The Colorado man who got sick with bird flu this year reported fatigue as his only symptom, and he recovered.

But because of the potential for a serious health threat, the WHO, CDC and US Department of Agriculture are closely monitoring outbreaks in the US and in other countries. The CDC has said it has ""produced a candidate vaccine virus,"" if it's needed, in response to a potential public health threat.

Signals that bird flu is becoming a bigger public health risk include multiple reports of H5N1 virus infections in people from exposure to birds, or spread between people, the CDC previously said.

Where is it in the US? How is it being monitored?

The bird flu has been detected and reported by the USDA in wild and domestic birds in most US states -- 46, as of the CDC's early November announcement.

Henry Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh, has been tracking the outbreak (as reported by The New York Times), and his map offers a visual representation of the outbreak across the country.

The first case was in a wild bird in South Carolina. Other cases were reported in some backyard flocks as well as some poultry farms, where animals are raised commercially for food. Any birds of the flocks that have cases of avian flu will not enter the food system, the USDA said.

How do you catch it? What precautions should you take if you're around birds?

Birds can shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, feces and mucus, according to the CDC. Humans can get sick by breathing in the virus, or by touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Most human bird flu cases have been reported in people who work directly with birds.

To avoid getting sick, avoid contact with wild birds, don't touch dead or sick birds you see, and avoid visiting bird markets or farms if you're traveling to another country, according to the CDC.

Extra precautions or monitoring may be taken if you work directly with birds, if you hunt birds or if you're a health care worker. If you have contact with an infected bird, contact your local or state health department. Here's a directory of local health departments in the US.

To avoid contamination from poultry of any kind, make sure to properly handle your poultry and eggs, and thoroughly cook them to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, the USDA says, to kill bacteria and viruses.

You can also report a dead bird to your local health department or wildlife agency, which will help public health officials track not only the bird flu but also viruses such as West Nile virus. Reporting dead birds might be especially important if you see more than one of them."
39,https://www.abqjournal.com/2548761/time-to-shore-up-defenses-against-flu-covid-19-and-other-unwelcome-viral-visitors.html,"Yes, it is the 2022-23 flu season. And while influenza makes you feel lousy-fever, body aches, tiredness, cough, the list of symptoms goes on and on – the flu vaccine helps us avoid/minimize the effects of the flu. Talk with your health care provider or the professionals administering the flu vaccine with any questions or concerns you have.

The CDC (cdc.gov/flu) gives the following recommendations:

Flu vaccine

Who should get it?

According to the CDC, everyone 6 months of age and older should get an influenza vaccine every season, with rare exceptions. There are several flu shots approved for use in people as young as 6 months old and older, and two are approved only for adults 65 years and older. Flu shots also are recommended for pregnant people and people with certain chronic health conditions. The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in people 2 years through 49 years of age, though people who are pregnant or who have certain medical conditions should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine. For people younger than 65 years, the CDC does not recommend any one flu vaccine over another.

Ideally you should get a flu vaccine by the end of October, but if you have not gotten it yet, it’s not too late. There are many places, including your local pharmacy and doctors’ offices, offering flu shots. Call or make an appointment online. Statewide public health offices are still offering influenza vaccine for children and adults. Contact your local office to schedule an appointment. Statewide influenza vaccination clinics can be found at

nmhealth.org/about/phd/idb/imp/fluv/

What’s different for 65 and up?

People 65 years and older are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications compared with young, healthy adults. This increased risk is due in part to changes in immune defenses with increasing age. People 65 years and older should get a flu shot, not a nasal spray vaccine. They can get any flu vaccine approved for use in their age group with no preference for any one vaccine over another. There are regular flu shots that are approved for use in people 65 years and older and there also are three vaccines designed specifically for this age group. Talk to the professional administering the vaccine to select one.

What other preventions can I take?

Many common-sense, good hygiene practices became habits during the pandemic, and we should keep doing them:

• Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them.

• Cover coughs and sneezes.

• Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Can I get flu from the vaccine?

No, the flu vaccine cannot cause flu. The vaccines either contain inactivated virus, meaning the viruses are no longer infectious, or a particle designed to look like a flu virus to your immune system. While the nasal spray flu vaccine does contain a live virus, the viruses are changed so that they cannot give you the flu.

COVID vaccine, booster

To schedule a COVID-19 vaccine or booster, which now covers the omicron variant, you can check with your doctor, local pharmacy or the N.M. Department of Health at its website (goodtimes.vaccinenm.org/boosters/) or by phone at 1-855-600-3453, option 3 any day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Can I get a COVID-19 and flu vaccine at the same time?

Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including a flu vaccine, at the same visit. If you have concerns about getting both vaccines at the same time, you should speak with a health care provider.

Other vaccinations

The CDC has an Immunization Schedule page on its website that factors in age (children and adolescents, adults 19 and older), medical conditions including pregnancy, and travel.

There is help identifying what vaccines you need; for example, it is recommended infants get two doses of Hepatitis B vaccine by age 2 months and persons 50 years and older receive the Zoster (shingles) vaccine.

The schedules at cdc.gov/vaccines/ lay out when it is optimal to get vaccines for many nasty, even fatal, but preventable diseases, including rotavirus, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertusis (whooping cough), flu, pneumonia, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (chicken pox), hepatitis A, human papilloma virus and meningococcal disease.

Vaccination record

Your physician should have your vaccination records; it’s important to keep them in the loop when you schedule and receive vaccines. In addition, VaxViewNM enables individuals, parents and guardians to access, save and/or print official immunization records. This eliminates the need to carry multiple or aged documents and allows you to access your shot record anytime you need. VaxViewNM is mobile friendly and uses two-factor authentication. The record includes your COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. Search VaxViewNM to get to the portal."

Influenza and other respiratory illnesses are spreading in Northwest Arkansas and the River Valley, according to health providers and officials.

""Flu season is upon us,"" said Dr. Upton Siddons with Baptist Health Family Clinic in Greenwood.

Siddons said he diagnosed his first patients with influenza earlier this week after primarily hearing secondhand reports of flu transmission in the community.

During November, Baptist Health in Fort Smith has seen about 50 flu patients in the emergency room and admitted 14 patients with the flu, according to Alicia Agent of Baptist Health.

Mercy Northwest is seeing a rise in cases of flu, with influenza A the most prevalent strain, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, according to senior communications specialist Nate Kuester.

The Rogers hospital has seen a continued increase in RSV infections since October, Kuester said.

Emergency rooms at Arkansas Children's in Springdale and Little Rock are busy amid a spike in flu cases coupled with other respiratory illnesses like RSV, according to Dr. Rick Barr, chief clinical officer of Arkansas Children's Hospital.

STATEWIDE DATA

The state Department of Health's latest flu report, released Wednesday, indicated a ""very high"" activity of flu-like illness in Arkansas during the week that ended Nov. 5.

Five more flu-related deaths in Arkansas were reported the week of Oct. 30 to Nov. 5, according to the department. Nine flu-related deaths in the state have been reported since the beginning of October. Thirty deaths were reported during the 2021-2022 season.

Flu season in the United States typically covers the fall and winter, with cases usually peaking between December and February and potentially lingering until May, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Thus far, the total of reported cases since Oct. 2 in Arkansas is 5,031, the department reported. That number grew 1,851 during the week ending Nov. 5, the largest reported increase of the flu season. About 14,800 cases were reported during last flu season.

Positive flu tests are reported by health care providers to the state Health Department's online database, but that number reflects only a portion of the state's total flu cases, according to the department.

Flu antigen tests, which distinguish the type of flu virus, indicated 89% were influenza A and 11% were influenza B so far this season, the department reported.

More than 5% of emergency room visits and outpatient visits were for reasons related to flu-like illness, compared to 4% the week before and less than 2% at the same time last year, the department reported.

An average of about 8.6% of Arkansas public school students were absent throughout the week, compared to 7.7% and 7.9% in previous weeks and about 7.5% a year ago, according to the department.

Crawford and Sebastian counties experienced absenteeism rates of 9.7% and 8.9%, respectively. Benton, Washington, Madison and Carroll counties each saw rates under 8%.

Three nursing homes in the state have reported flu outbreaks this season.

Nationally, 25 states have ""high"" or ""very high"" levels of respiratory illness, according to a CDC report released Thursday.

The South has seen the highest levels of recent flu activity. Around Arkansas, border states Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee reported very high levels of flu activity this week. Missouri and Oklahoma reported moderate levels of flu activity, according to the report.

AN ACTIVE FLU SEASON

The flu is a significant contributor to the current circulation of respiratory viruses, the CDC reported.

Other viruses include RSV, which spiked around the beginning of fall in Arkansas and other parts of the country.

""While Arkansas Children's anticipates a surge in RSV cases each winter, this marks the second consecutive year we've experienced a spike among kids during the late summer and early fall,"" Barr said.

Flu seasons can also be difficult to predict, though some health officials and providers have expected a more severe season than in previous years.

Mercy physicians expected a more active flu season, according to Kuester.

Dr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state Health Department's chief medical officer, said in September she also expected ""a more normal"" flu season.

Safety measures during the covid-19 pandemic likely had an effect on the transmission of influenza, according to Siddons.

The 2021-2022 flu season was mild compared to flu seasons before the pandemic, according to the CDC. In the United States, the flu was associated with an estimated 5,000 deaths, 10,000 hospitalizations and 9 million illnesses last flu season.

In the first month of this flu season, the federal agency estimates there have been between 1,300 and 3,000 deaths, 23,000 and 48,000 hospitalizations and 2.8 million and 6.6 million illnesses related to the flu.

In addition to flu viruses, the CDC also expects covid-19 to spread during the fall and winter. The contagious respiratory illnesses are caused by different viruses, though it is difficult to tell the difference by symptoms alone.

It is possible to have both the flu and covid-19, or another respiratory illness, at the same time. Flu and covid-19 tests can help identify the viruses, while some PCR tests can distinguish between them simultaneously, according to the federal agency.

FIGHTING TRANSMISSION

These viral infections should not be taken lightly, according to Dillaha. Vaccinations will help protect residents and their families against flu and covid-19 viruses, she said.

""Given these early trends and the strong efficacy of this year's vaccine, we strongly encourage all eligible children and their families to receive the flu vaccine soon,"" Barr said.

Older adults, young children, pregnant women, nursing home residents, people with chronic health conditions and smokers are more likely to have health problems from contracting the flu, according to the state Health Department.

These people should prioritize receiving the flu vaccine, Siddons said. Basic hygienic practices like washing hands and covering the mouth while sneezing or coughing can also make a difference, he said.

Everyone 6 months or older should get a routine flu vaccination, unless they have a specific health reason to decline, according to the CDC.

Local health units across the state administer flu shots at no cost to residents.

41,https://www.foxnews.com/health/california-hospitals-using-overflow-tents-rising-number-flu-patients,"Several Southern California hospitals have begun using overflow tents outside emergency rooms to cope with a rising number of patients with flu and other respiratory illnesses.

The San Diego-Union Tribune reported Friday that overflow tents were put up at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, Jacobs Medical Center at UC San Diego Health in La Jolla and Sharp Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa to handle an increase in respiratory illness.

Scripps hospitals and doctor's offices reported 1,695 positive flu tests since Sept. 1, up from 471 during the same time period one year ago.

The move comes amid a rise in flu symptoms in emergency room patients in San Diego County. About 9% of these patients had flu symptoms last week, up from 7% two weeks ago, according to a county report.

The San Diego-Union Tribune also flagged an increase in patients with COVID-19 symptoms, though not as quickly, according to the county’s weekly respiratory illness report.

EARLY, SURPRISING SURGE OF RSV IN KIDS HAS HOSPITALS, MEDICAL CENTERS CONCERNED

""The fear is that everything is just sort of bouncing off everything else and once you’ve been through the flu you could still get hit by COVID or whatever other virus you’re going to get,"" said Dr. Ghazala Sharieff, Scripps Health's chief medical officer of acute care operations and clinical excellence.

""I’m hopeful, but we’re still kind of planning that it’s going to be this way through February,"" Sharieff said.

Generally, the flu hits hardest from late December through February.

The Southern Hemisphere also dealt with an earlier than usual influenza season. Chile's influenza positivity rates reached epidemic thresholds as early as January, several months sooner than usual.

AMOXICILLIN PRESCRIBED FOR CHILDREN IS IN SHORT SUPPLY, FDA SAYS

Health experts said it was not immediately clear whether flu cases would reach an earlier-than-usual peak in California, which typically sees the bulk of cases in December through February, or a prolonged flu season.

Much of the United States is seeing a fast start to the flu season. Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more flu cases are being reported than is typically expected at this time.

JUST 2 OMICRON SUBVARIANTS MAKE UP 44% OF ALL US COVID CASES

On Friday, the CDC reported that the flu and similar viral illnesses are notably high in Georgia, New York City, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, D.C.

""Early increases in seasonal influenza activity continue nationwide. The southeastern and south-central areas of the country are reporting the highest levels of activity followed by the Mid-Atlantic and the south-central West Coast regions."" the CDC said.

Most of those are influenza A, specifically a strain called H3N2. While any version of the flu can be dangerous in vulnerable populations, this strain has been known to cause more severe illness.

But what should we prepare for this time around? Here's everything you need to know: Should we expect a winter COVID wave? Public health experts are certainly worried, especially considering the rising case counts in the U.K. and across Europe, The Scientist reports. ""In the past, what's happened in Europe often has been a harbinger for what's about to happen in the United States,"" Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told NPR at the beginning of October. ""So I think the bottom line message for us in this country is: We have to be prepared for what they are beginning to see in Europe."" Skip advert Given widespread immunity following the BA.5 Omicron variant surge, mid-August forecasts from the so-called COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub suggested ""the United States could be in for a relatively quiet COVID-19 season ... as long as vaccine-booster campaigns began quickly and new variants didn't emerge,"" Nature reports. But it's also not yet clear if the European ""surge"" is a result of ""behavioral changes and climate,"" like colder weather pushing gatherings indoors where the virus is more likely to spread, or something more sinister, Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist involved with the modeling hub, told NPR. If the former, Lessler said, the U.S. ""might be able to avoid similar upticks if there is broad uptake of the bivalent vaccine."" But if it's the latter, something like ""immune escape across several variants with convergent evolution, the outlook for the U.S. may be more concerning.""

The surge in the three viruses ""is almost predictable at this point in the pandemic,"" Dean Blumberg, MD, of the University of California Davis Health, told WebMD. ""All the respiratory viruses are out of whack."" What can I do to protect myself from COVID and the ""tripledemic"" this winter? First and foremost, get vaccinated for both the flu and COVID-19. Even if you get infected, the bivalent booster and/or primary series of COVID vaccinations will protect you from serious disease and death. Wash your hands often, and always stay home from work or school if you're feeling sick. Wear a mask if you can. If you're relatively healthy, ""none of those viruses is a big threat to you necessarily,"" explained the Times' Apoorva Mandavilli, but they are ""a threat to our health care system, which is already so stretched."" So do your part to ensure hospitals remain accessible for those most vulnerable to COVID and the ""tripledemic,"" like children, pregnant people, and the elderly. ""The boosting is the thing that has to get buckled down,"" cardiologist Dr. Eric Topol told the Times. ""As a nation, we are terribly under-boosted."" ""We need everyone to step up,"" added White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha. ""This is literally about saving lives of tens of thousands of Americans this fall and winter,"" and ""[t]he great news here is that, unlike past winters, we are in control."""
43,https://www.newdelhitimes.com/what-us-election-results-mean-for-the-future-of-ukraine-aid/,"If Republicans win the House, where does that leave Ukraine?

It’s a question that is top of mind in Washington as the GOP draws closer to winning the majority in the U.S. House. Some fear the end of Democratic control in Congress — and the empowerment of “America First” conservatives — could ultimately result in the curtailment of American assistance as Ukraine battles Russia’s invasion.

Recent comments from Kevin McCarthy, who is in line for speaker if Republicans win the House, exacerbated those fears. He warned that Republicans wouldn’t support writing a “blank check” for Ukraine if they captured the majority.

But the hard-line rhetoric isn’t the end of the story. While Republican control of the House is likely to make sending tranches of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine more difficult, support for the country runs deep in both parties.

Here is a look at the factors at play:

WHAT THE U.S. HAS GIVEN SO FAR

Since the Russian invasion began in February, Congress has approved tens of billions in emergency security and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. The Biden administration has also shipped billions worth of weapons and equipment from military inventories.

In September, lawmakers approved about $12.3 billion in Ukraine-related aid as part of a bill that finances the federal government through Dec. 16. The money included assistance for the Ukrainian military as well as money to help the country’s government provide basic services to its citizens.

That comes on top of more than $50 billion provided in two previous bills.

STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT

All along, financial support for Ukraine has garnered strong bipartisan support. In the Senate, GOP leader Mitch McConnell and Richard Shelby, the lead Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee, were early and consistent voices in favor of Ukraine aid.

In recent days, other Republicans including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Rick Scott of Florida have insisted in interviews that their party’s support for the Ukrainians is resolute.

“I think we have to continue to do everything we can to support Ukraine, who wants to defend their freedom and stop Russia from continuing to expand,” Scott said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware also made a bipartisan show of support by visiting Ukraine just days before the election.

“I am confident that bipartisan robust American support for the fight of the Ukrainian people will continue in Congress,” Coons said. “The United States has long been a nation that fights for freedom, and this is the most important fight for freedom in the world today.”

The picture is similar in the House, where Ukrainian aid enjoys majority support. Even a letter published last month by the liberal flank of the party, asking the Biden administration to pursue diplomatic talks with Russia over the war, was quickly retracted after an outpouring of criticism from both parties.

President Joe Biden also attempted to ease concerns in a post-election briefing Wednesday, expressing hope that he would be able to continue his “bipartisan approach” to supporting Ukraine. He said he intends to invite congressional leaders from both parties to the White House later this month for a discussion about how to “advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States.”

GROWING FAR-RIGHT OPPOSITION

Yet support for Ukraine is far from universal in the Republican Party.

Some lawmakers on the right, particularly those aligned with Donald Trump’s “America First” philosophy of foreign policy, say the United States cannot afford to give billions to Ukraine at a time of record-high inflation at home.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, told a rally of Trump supporters in Iowa last week that, “under Republicans, not another penny will go to Ukraine.” In Ohio, Republican JD Vance, who just won the state’s Senate race, campaigned on ending financial support for the country, saying Congress has “got to stop the money spigot to Ukraine eventually.”

McCarthy seemed to be giving a nod to the Ukraine skeptics with his comments before the election.

“I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they’re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,” McCarthy said in the pre-election interview. “They just won’t do it. … It’s not a free blank check.”

McCarthy later walked back those comments, telling CNN that he’s very supportive of Ukraine but thinks there should be “accountability going forward.”

Biden stressed that his administration has not granted every request from the Ukrainians, including their demand for a no-fly zone that would risk pulling America into the war.

“We’ve not given Ukraine a blank check,” Biden said. “There’s a lot of things that Ukraine wants we didn’t — we didn’t do.”

FUTURE OF AID

Despite the escalating opposition from the right, there is little risk of Congress ending America’s financial and military support for Ukraine anytime soon.

Majorities in the House and Senate back the alliance with Ukraine, saying the cost is worth paying to defend a democratic ally and resist Russian expansion.

And most Americans who voted in the midterms were firmly behind the military and financial support for Ukraine, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 94,000 voters. About 4 in 10 said it was about right and 3 in 10 said it should be more active, while only about 3 in 10 wanted the U.S. to provide less to Ukraine.

Yet it’s clear that a Republican takeover of the House would make passing additional aid for Ukraine harder. McCarthy is likely to be under intense pressure from the right to take a hard line with the Biden administration, making it more difficult for him to work with Democrats.

With that reality in mind, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are eying the lame-duck session after the election as an opportunity to lock in billions of dollars in additional military assistance for Ukraine. That aid could be passed in an end-of-year government funding bill and ensure American support for months to come.

VIEW FROM ABROAD

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials are monitoring the midterm election results closely. One official on Wednesday acknowledged having stayed awake the night before, hitting refresh again and again on his phone to track the results.

But the country’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said Wednesday that he did not anticipate American support would erode.

“I have repeatedly met with representatives of the Senate and Congress, and each time the delegations were bipartisan,” Resnikov said at a news conference. “I clearly understand that the support of the United States will remain bipartisan and bicameral, too.”

Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s trade and economic development minister, said Thursday that regardless of U.S. support, the country is intensifying efforts to run leaner on spending, even as Ukrainians fight for what they see as an “existential war.”

Svyrydenko said that while there had been no pressure from American officials for Ukraine to cut its need for foreign help, Ukrainian leaders know they have to do more to stabilize the economy itself even as they battle Russian forces.

Ukraine’s emphasis at the war’s outset had been rapidly marshaling military aid from its allies, “but we understand that one day we should rely very well on ourselves again,” she said.

Some 810 of the alleged Russian casualties — claims of enemy losses by both parties in the conflict are near-impossible to fully verify, given the circumstances — were inflicted in the last day of the fighting, reported Ukrinform, citing a post on the official Facebook page of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU).

All told, the Ukrainians claim to have “liquidated” 80,210 Russian personnel, 2,838 tanks, 5,730 armoured personnel carriers, 1,829 artillery systems, and hundreds of multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) and anti-aircraft warfare systems.

They also claim significant Russian air losses, including 278 aircraft, 261 helicopters, and over 1,500 aerial drones,

“Punch the Occupier! Together we will win! Our power is in the truth!” the Ukrainian military declared at the end of its Facebook post announcing the alleged Russian losses.

The Russians, for their part, have been more cautious in their claims of Ukrainian losses, largely avoiding putting a number of Ukrainian fatalities in favour of emphasising supposedly destroyed equipment exclusively.

Most recently, the country’s Ministry of Defence claimed to have destroyed 6,550 Ukrainian tanks and other armoured combat vehicles, 886 MLRS vehicles, 3,574 field artillery guns and mortars, 333 aircraft, 175 helicopters, and 388 anti-aircraft missile systems, among others — figures close to and in some cases higher than those produced by the Ukrainians.

MYKOLAIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian police officers returned Saturday, along with TV and radio services, to the southern city of Kherson following the withdrawal of Russian troops, part of fast but cautious efforts to make the only regional capital captured by Russia livable after months of occupation. Yet one official still described the city as “a humanitarian catastrophe.”

People across Ukraine awoke from a night of jubilant celebrating after the Kremlin announced its troops had withdrawn to the other side of the Dnieper River from Kherson. The Ukrainian military said it was overseeing “stabilization measures” around the city to make sure it was safe.

The Russian retreat represented a significant setback for the Kremlin some six weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin annexed the Kherson region and three other provinces in southern and eastern Ukraine in breach of international law and declared them Russian territory.

The national police chief of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko, said Saturday on that about 200 officers were at work in the city, setting up checkpoints and documenting evidence of possible war crimes. Police teams also were working to identify and neutralize unexploded ordnance and one sapper was wounded Saturday while demining an administrative building, Klymenko said.

Ukraine’s communications watchdog said national TV and radio broadcasts had resumed and an adviser to Kherson’s mayor said humanitarian aid and supplies had begun to arrive from the neighboring Mykolaiv region.

But the adviser, Roman Holovnya, described the situation in Kherson as “a humanitarian catastrophe.” He said the remaining residents lacked water, medicine and food — and key basics like bread went unbaked because a lack of electricity.

“The occupiers and collaborators did everything possible so that those people who remained in the city suffered as much as possible over those days, weeks, months of waiting” for Ukraine’s forces to arrive, Holovnya said. “Water supplies are practically nonexistent.”

The chairman of Khersonoblenergo, the region's prewar power provider, said electricity was being returned “to every settlement in the Kherson region immediately after the liberation.""

Despite the efforts to restore normal civilian life, Russian forces remain close by. The General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Saturday the Russians were fortifying their battle lines on the river's eastern bank after abandoning the capital. About 70% of the Kherson region still remains under Russian control.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address Saturday that Ukrainian forces have established control of more than 60 settlements in the Kherson region and “stabilization measures are also ongoing in Kherson itself.”

“Everywhere in the liberated territory, our explosives technicians have a lot of work to do. Almost 2,000 explosive items have already been removed,” Zelenskyy said. “Before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all critical infrastructure — communication, water supply, heat, electricity.”

Photos on social media Saturday showed Ukrainian activists removing memorial plaques put up by the occupation authorities the Kremlin installed to run the Kherson region. A Telegram post on Yellow Ribbon, Ukrainian resistance movement, showed two people in a park taking down plaques picturing Soviet-era military figures.

Moscow's announcement that Russian forces were withdrawing across the Dnieper River, which divides both the Kherson region and Ukraine, followed a stepped-up Ukrainian counteroffensive in the country's south. In the last two months, Ukraine's military claimed to have reclaimed dozens of towns and villages north of the city of Kherson, and the military said that's where stabilization activities were taking place.

Russian state news agency Tass quoted an official in Kherson’s Kremlin-appointed administration on Saturday as saying that Henichesk, a city on the Azov Sea 200 kilometers southeast of Kherson, would now serve as the region’s “temporary capital.”

Ukrainian media derided the announcement, with the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper saying Russia “had made up a new capital” for the region.

Across much of Ukraine, moments of jubilation marked the exit of Russian forces, since a retreat from Kherson and other areas on the Dnieper’s west bank would appear to shatter Russian hopes to press an offensive west to Mykolaiv and Odesa to cut off Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea.

In Odesa, the Black Sea port, residents draped themselves in Ukraine's blue-and-yellow flags, shared Champagne and held up flag-colored cards with the word “Kherson” on them.

But like Zelenskyy, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba sought to temper the excitement.

“We are winning battles on the ground, but the war continues,"" he said from Cambodia, where he was attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Kuleba brought up the prospect of the Ukrainian army finding evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Kherson, just as it did after Russian pullbacks in the Kyiv and Kharkiv regions.

“Every time we liberate a piece of our territory, when we enter a city liberated from Russian army, we find torture rooms and mass graves with civilians tortured and murdered by Russian army in the course of the occupation,"" Ukraine's top diplomat said. ""It’s not easy to speak with people like this. But I said that every war ends with diplomacy and Russia has to approach talks in good faith.”

U.S. assessments this week showed Russia's war in Ukraine may already have killed or wounded tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of soldiers.

Elsewhere, Russia continued its grinding offensive in Ukraine’s industrial east, targeting the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, the Ukrainian General Staff said.

Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko reported Saturday that two civilians were killed and four wounded over the last day as battles heated up around Bakhmut and Avdiivka, a small city that has remained in Ukrainian hands.

Russia’s push to capture Bakhmut demonstrates the Kremlin’s desire for visible gains following weeks of setbacks. It would also pave the way to move onto other Ukrainian strongholds in the heavily contested Donetsk region.

In the Dnipropetrovsk region west of Donetsk, Russia troops again shelled communities near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the Ukrainian regional governor said.

WASHINGTON — If Republicans win the House, where does that leave Ukraine?

It’s a question that is top of mind in Washington as the GOP draws closer to winning the majority in the U.S. House. Some fear the end of Democratic control in Congress — and the empowerment of “America First” conservatives — could ultimately result in the curtailment of American assistance as Ukraine battles Russia’s invasion.

Recent comments from Kevin McCarthy, who is in line for speaker if Republicans win the House, exacerbated those fears. He warned that Republicans wouldn’t support writing a “blank check” for Ukraine if they captured the majority.

But the hard-line rhetoric isn’t the end of the story. While Republican control of the House is likely to make sending tranches of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine more difficult, support for the country runs deep in both parties.

Its creeping artillery war to seize the eastern region of Donbas has ground to a bloody halt. It has lost a chunk of stolen territory south of the city of Kharkiv, and this week announced a retreat from Kherson, the only provincial capital it had captured since its invasion in February. With each setback, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has sought new ways to torment Ukraine. The latest is a relentless bombardment that seeks to wreck Ukraine’s infrastructure. Residents of the capital have been told they may have to evacuate if the power grid collapses, halting water and sewage services.

Power cuts have not sapped Ukraine’s will to fight. But they are a reminder that, eight months after his unprovoked invasion, Mr Putin keeps looking for ways to raise the stakes. Some worry he might blow up a dam on the Dnieper river, as Stalin did in 1941, to slow his adversaries’ advance.

The ever-evolving Russian assault also raises an awkward question: how long will America and Europe keep providing Ukraine with the billions of dollars’ worth of military and economic aid it needs every month to fend Russia off? “For as long as it takes,” say Western leaders. But many of their citizens reject the idea of bankrolling an indefinite conflict with Russia. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Rome on November 5th, calling for an end to the fighting. “We don’t want war. No weapons, no sanctions. Where is diplomacy?” read one placard.

Wary Washington

In America, too, questions have been raised. Hard-left Democrats recently issued a call, swiftly retracted, for negotiations. Gains by America-first Republicans in the midterm elections on November 8th, although smaller than expected, are a reminder that American politics might change dramatically after the next presidential election, in two years’ time, and with it policy on Ukraine.

Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden’s national-security adviser, made an unannounced trip to Kyiv on November 4th to promise “unwavering” support. But he also urged Ukraine to think about future peace terms. It has since emerged that he has been in touch with his Russian counterparts, to warn them not to use nuclear weapons. On November 9th Mr Biden said Russia and Ukraine would “lick their wounds” after the battle for Kherson, and might then be ready for compromise. He insisted he would not tell Ukraine what to do.

In private, Western and Ukrainian officials are starting to ponder what a stable outcome might look like. Will Ukraine become a new Finland, forced to cede land to its invaders and to remain neutral for decades? Or another West Germany, with its national territory partitioned by war and its democratic half absorbed into NATO ? A much-discussed template is Israel, a country under constant threat that has been able to defend itself without formal alliances but with extensive military help from America.

The precise terms of any negotiated settlement depend on what happens on the battlefield. There is likely to be a lot more fighting before either side is ready to end the war. Russia and Ukraine have each lost, by one estimate, roughly 100,000 soldiers, killed and wounded, but both still hope to manoeuvre to a more favourable position.

The retreat from Kherson is a humiliation for Mr Putin. But it will give Russian forces a more easily defended line along the Dnieper river. Mr Putin shows no sign of throwing in the towel. He has mobilised hundreds of thousands more recruits. Some have been rushed into battle with little training or equipment to hold the line; the rest may be used for a renewed push next year.

Ukraine, for its part, hopes to maintain its momentum. Its army is getting reinforcements this winter, in the form of thousands of recruits trained by Britain and other Western countries. Western arms continue to arrive. On November 4th the Pentagon announced another arms package, worth $400m, including 45 refurbished T-72B tanks and 1,100 drones. The first new NASAMS anti-aircraft batteries were deployed this week.

The West’s stocks of weapons are not unlimited. European armies have eaten deep into theirs; even mighty America worries about eroding its own ability to fight future wars. It is Russia, however, that seems to face the most immediate shortages. It has used up most of its precision bombs and missiles, and is struggling to replace them because of sanctions. It is obtaining fresh weapons from the likes of Iran and perhaps North Korea. (China has so far heeded American warnings to stay out of the war.)

Cold calculation

Mr Putin is hoping his campaign to destroy Ukraine’s electricity grid will freeze the country into submission, or at least turn it into a weak, failing state. But the evidence of past conflicts is that aerial bombing of civilians, in the absence of an effective ground campaign, rarely secures victory. Nearly 90% of Ukrainians want the country to keep fighting.

In Russia, according to the Levada Centre, a pollster, only 36% want to press on with the war, whereas 57% favour peace talks. At the same time, support for Mr Putin remains at 79%. Russians, it seems, would like the war to end but, starved of impartial news, do not blame Mr Putin for it. Still, the more he tries to dragoon them into fighting, the more he risks losing popular support.

Ukraine’s more avid Western supporters think that, with time, Ukraine will become stronger, and Russia weaker. But Mr Putin is hoping that “General Winter” will somehow revive his fortunes, if not by weakening Ukraine’s will to fight then by gnawing at the West’s readiness to support it, as the heating bills balloon in Europe.

Mr Putin claims that he is ready to negotiate (from the starting point that the West should recognise his theft of Ukrainian territory) but that Ukraine’s Western “masters” have prevented it from talking. The two sides held lengthy talks after Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and part of Donbas in 2014. They talked again in the spring, as Russia besieged Kyiv. But Ukraine set its face against further negotiations after Russia’s retreat from Kyiv in April revealed widespread atrocities against civilians. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, suggested this week that talks could be revived, but only if Russia was willing to give back Ukrainian land, pay compensation and accept responsibility for war crimes.

The West is vague about its own aims. Mr Biden has at times mused about wanting to see Mr Putin ousted from power; at others he has talked about finding “off-ramps” for the Russian leader. He defined his goals most clearly in a guest article in the New York Times in May: “a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression”. Notably, that left out the question of Ukraine’s borders. Western leaders say this is for Ukraine to decide; their aim is to strengthen its negotiating hand.

More recently, though, Ukraine’s backers have sounded more specific. In a statement on October 11th, leaders of the G 7 group of industrialised countries offered their “full support to Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty in its internationally recognised borders”. They demanded that Russia “completely and unconditionally withdraw” from all seized lands. Among other things, they pledged to find ways of using seized Russian assets to help fund Ukraine’s reconstruction.

In need of a break

“The G 7 statement is basically a demand for total Russian surrender, which is not a plausible diplomatic outcome. Diplomacy by definition involves give and take. The expectation should not be another Treaty of Versailles,” says Samuel Charap of the RAND Corporation, an American think-tank, referring to the punitive terms imposed on Germany at the end of the first world war. The West, Ukraine and Russia, he argues, should start talking, if only to set the groundwork for more substantive negotiations in future: “Fighting and talking at the same time should be the norm.”

Many disagree. “Keep up the pressure. Don’t be in a hurry to draw lines on a map. It would be bureaucratic suicide. Somebody will put it up on Twitter alongside the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact,” retorts Dan Fried of the Atlantic Council, another American think-tank, alluding to Nazi Germany’s and the Soviet Union’s carve-up of Poland in 1939.

Few Western leaders question Ukraine’s ambition to recapture the territory lost since Russia invaded in February. Many would support efforts to reclaim the parts of Donbas seized in 2014. But opinion is more divided when it comes to reconquering Crimea. Many worry that the prospect of losing the peninsula might prompt a dangerous escalation from Mr Putin.

To some in the Biden administration, the war is a matter of principle: territory should never be seized by force, so all Russian gains must be reversed. Others, doubting Ukraine’s ability to reconquer much more, think the time for diplomacy is soon. Either way, America is in no rush to spell out diplomatic positions that might cause rifts in the pro-Ukraine camp.

Another pressing concern is the nature of future Western security guarantees for Ukraine. They will need to be robust given that Russia will probably remain a threat to Ukraine for as long as Mr Putin is in power, if not longer. Several central and eastern European countries favour Ukraine’s rapid admission to NATO , on the grounds that the alliance’s commitment to mutual defence would firmly deter Russia. For all its nuclear menaces, it has so far refrained from overtly striking NATO territory.

The Biden administration, though, is wary of having to extend its nuclear umbrella to a country in a state of latent or actual conflict with Russia. Throughout, Mr Biden has been careful to minimise the risk of a direct NATO -Russia conflict for fear that it would lead to “World War III”. Several nato members in western Europe are similarly sceptical.

So attention has turned to interim, or alternative, arrangements. In September Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former secretary-general of NATO , and Andriy Yermak, Mr Zelensky’s chief of staff, proposed a “Kyiv Security Compact” which would offer security assistance short of a mutual-defence pact. Some in Ukraine considered it a betrayal. Modelled on Western support for Israel, about which Mr Zelensky has spoken, the compact would strengthen Ukraine’s armed forces—in effect turning the current ad hoc support into a systematic, long-term commitment.

Ukraine’s partners would promise “multi-decade” investments in the country’s defence industry, massive weapons transfers, training, joint exercises and intelligence support. The compact would require neither Russia’s assent nor Ukraine’s neutrality. It would not preclude NATO membership. In some circumstances, there could be military intervention to help Ukraine. If it were attacked, the signatories would “use all elements of their national and collective power and take appropriate measures—which may include diplomatic, economic and military means.” A wider group of countries, including Asian allies, would reinforce such military assistance with sanctions on Russia, including provisions to “snap back” any of the current penalties that may be lifted as part of a deal.

Even this may be too ambitious for Team Biden. Some ask, for instance, what commitments Ukraine would take on, by way of reforms to strengthen democracy, say, or to fight corruption. The parallel with Israel is imperfect. Among other things, Israel is a nuclear power and occupies Arab land. For Mykola Bielieskov of the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in Kyiv, the Israeli model “is not only about mobilising our partners externally; it’s also about explaining to people what it means to live next door to a crazy neighbour, to existential threats.”

The sky must be the limit

Whatever the diplomatic template, Russia’s blitz has proved that the West will need to help Ukraine create a properly integrated and layered air-defence system, mixing fighter aircraft, surface-to-air batteries and shoulder-launched weapons. At the moment weapons are arriving piecemeal and often cannot exchange data. There are also worries about Ukraine running out of certain types of air-defence munitions. If that were to happen Russia could then deploy much more air power in support of ground troops.

Uncertain harvest

Ukraine’s mix-and-match weapons—a “Mr Potato Head” arsenal, as some call it—cause problems elsewhere. For instance, it has no fewer than 14 different types of artillery pieces, with an average brigade operating four different sorts. “This is a logistical nightmare for them, especially when we talk about ammunition,” says Nick Reynolds of RUSI , a British think-tank. Some of the weapons are wearing out badly, and Europe’s defence industry, sapped by decades of low spending, is poorly placed to produce spare parts. “Red lights are flashing in terms of that support being available,” adds Mr Reynolds.

How long the war goes on depends mainly on Mr Putin. He is in a bind, both in Ukraine and at home. Moderate technocrats are worried about the strains on the economy; “national patriots” such as Yevgeny Prigozhin, who commands the Wagner mercenary group, have called for purges of supposedly treacherous generals.

A pause to play at diplomacy may suit Mr Putin for a time—particularly if it allows him to consolidate some territorial gains. That may explain his recent toning down of nuclear rhetoric and his sudden casting of Ukrainians as victims of Western aggression. “The West is throwing Ukrainians into a furnace”; Russia, in contrast, “has always treated Ukrainian people with respect,” Mr Putin declared on November 4th. (His propagandists and officials, though, still talk of “de-Satanising” Ukraine.) The shift fits another of Mr Putin’s guises, as the champion of a global movement to cast off Western dominance.

In all this Mr Putin is seeking to woo waverers, especially in the global South. He also wants to reassure friends such as China and India, which have made plain their disapproval of his nuclear recklessness. Above all Mr Putin is interested in reaching one rich-world listener: Donald Trump, whose allies in Congress question American aid to Ukraine and who may soon announce another run for president.

For all his setbacks, Mr Putin is not yet out of options to persecute Ukraine and try to divide the West. Militarily, he could commit more of his air force and mobilise more troops. In the covert “grey zone” he could sabotage undersea gas pipelines and internet connections to the West, conduct bigger cyber-attacks, interfere with communications satellites and step up disinformation campaigns. He could also sink ships carrying grain from Ukraine. Ultimately, he could use tactical nuclear weapons. All this, though, would come at heavy cost: it would make Russia even more of a pariah, weaken him at home and might provoke harsh retaliation.

The stakes are higher for Mr Putin than for the West. But they are highest for Ukrainians, many of whom mistrust the very idea of talks with Russia and see military victory as their only option—even if it takes years to achieve. The more land it can regain, Ukraine reckons, the greater the chance of getting rid of Mr Putin. Yet that same prospect alarms many in the West: a rout of the Russian army might be what pushes Mr Putin to go nuclear. That is one reason why Team Biden long ago stopped talking about helping Ukraine “win”.

As it has often done with Israel, America may at some point try to limit Ukraine’s ambitions. It need not do so overtly; it can simply withhold the arms Ukraine needs, as it already does to an extent. It declines to provide Western aircraft, Patriot air-defence missiles and longer-range ATACMS strike missiles for fear that they might goad Russia to use nuclear weapons.

All this explains why some Ukrainians have been circulating a bittersweet message issued to Finnish troops in 1940 at the end of the “Winter War” with the Soviet Union by their commander, Carl Gustaf Mannerheim. The vastly outnumbered Finns had inflicted heavy losses on Soviet forces but nonetheless had to cede territory because help from their friends had dried up, Mannerheim wrote, signing off with the words, “We are proudly conscious of the historic duty which we shall continue to fulfil; the defence of that Western civilisation which has been our heritage for centuries, but we know also that we have paid to the very last penny any debt we may have owed the West.”

Ukraine’s fate depends not just on the valour of its soldiers or resilience of its people, but also on external factors it cannot control: the inscrutable calculations of Russia’s despotic ruler and the fortitude of its friends. The benefits to the West of the war are already clear. Russia has been enormously weakened, making Europe’s flank much easier to defend. For Ukraine, which has suffered horrific losses, the outcome looks much less certain. ■

The sudden collapse of crypto exchange “FTX” and its Bankruptcy filing today, has revealed that FTX presently suffers from $10-$50 BILLION in liabilities with almost ZERO assets . . . and among those liabilities, are “investments” made by . . . . UKRAINE . . . .

At this early hour, it __appears__ that tens-of-billions in American “Military Aid” to Ukraine, which was allegedly to be used to fight Russia, was cash that Ukraine DID NOT use to fight Russia, but instead invested into FTX!

And, as you might guess from the Bankruptcy filing . . . . it now seems that all the money . . . is gone.

Yes, you read that correctly: Instead of using US Military Aid to fight Russia, Ukraine “invested” part or all of it, into FTX, and right now, it looks like all the money is gone.

Democrat Donations

Also at this early hour, it now also __appears__ that the Chief of FTX, Sam Blankman-Fried, was the #2 donor to the Democrats. He was only outspent by Soros himself!

It __seems__ Ukraine was receiving money from the US, Ukraine sent it to FTX, and FTX sent it to Democrats, who originally voted to send it to Ukraine. At this hour, it __appears__ to some observers, to be pure, criminal, money-laundering, and a criminal conspiracy to violate campaign finance laws.

It now seems to closely-watching observers that the kid burned his own company — and his own ass — just to make sure the Dems won the mid-term elections, and seems to have done it by pulling the rug out from all those that had funds there in FTX.

So the collapse of FTX is now linked not only to Ukraine, but also to US Democrat politicians who got money from Sam Blankman-Fried, to campaign for the just-ended elections!

49,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/12/zelenskyy-says-russia-destroyed-khersons-critical-infrastructure,"Ukraine’s president says communications, water, heat, electricity have been disrupted as Russians left the city.

Russian forces destroyed critical infrastructure in the southern city of Kherson before their withdrawal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, as Kyiv’s military retook control of the southeastern city.

“Before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity,” Zelenskyy stated in a video address on Saturday.

“[Russians] everywhere have the same goal: to humiliate people as much as possible. But we will restore everything, believe me,” he said.

Jubilant residents welcomed troops arriving in the city centre on Friday after Russia abandoned the only regional capital it had captured since the start of the war in February.

Ukrainian troops retook control of more than 60 settlements in the Kherson region, Zelenskyy said, adding that almost 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells had been dealt with so far.

Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine was “winning battles on the ground. But the war continues.”

Ukraine’s triumphant recovery of Kherson was welcomed by the United States as an “extraordinary victory”.

“It’s a big moment and it’s due to the incredible tenacity and skill of the Ukrainians, backed by the relentless and united support of the United States and our allies,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said while travelling to Cambodia with President Joe Biden for a regional summit.

‘Most decisive’ event in the war

Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig, reporting from the Kherson region, said Moscow’s withdrawal was the “most decisive” event in this war so far.

“It’s boosted the morale of Ukrainian soldiers who say … they now believe they can win this war.”

Ukraine’s National Police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said some 200 officers were at work in the city, setting up checkpoints and documenting evidence of possible war crimes.

He urged Kherson residents to watch out for possible landmines laid by the Russian troops, saying one policeman had been wounded while de-mining an administrative building.

Officials also said humanitarian aid was being delivered to the city’s residents.

“The situation is very difficult because Russia created intolerable conditions for the people to stay and live in Kherson. And before the retreat of Russian troops, Russia had deliberately tried to create a humanitarian catastrophe,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Policy.

“The process of de-mining has already started, and humanitarian aid has started to flow to the city. And we hope within a month that we will open post offices, we will start giving money and pensions and salaries to workers in Kherson,” he told Al Jazeera.

About 70 percent of the Kherson region remains under Moscow’s control, with Russian troops fortifying their battle lines on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, according to the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces.

Russia established the Ukrainian city of Henichesk as the Kherson region’s temporary administrative capital following its withdrawal from Kherson city.

Sergey Markov, a former adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told Al Jazeera that losing Kherson was a blow for Russia, but that Moscow’s mobilisation means it will be Ukraine’s last victory.

“It’s really embarrassing for Russia. We used to believe that Russian army is the second army in the world, after the United States. Probably even equal to the United States. So, it’s depressive for the population, it’s depressive for the army, but we still believe this is the last military victory of the Ukrainian army,” he said.

“The main reason is that Ukraine has a total military mobilisation over the spring. Ukraine is five times less than Russia in terms of population, but Ukraine’s army is twice as big as the Russian army. But now that privilege will be over for Ukrainian army, because 300,000 mobilised Russians will come to the Russian army.”

The Kremlin meanwhile insisted Kherson was still part of Russia and it did not regret annexing the entire Kherson region. Russia announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, in September — a step dubbed illegal by Kyiv and denounced by Western countries.

The full Ukrainian recapture of the Kherson region would disrupt a vital land bridge for Russia between its mainland and the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014."
