SCOPE data collection+coding platform (2GZM demo)

WARNING (THIS README NEEDS TO BE UPDATED)

## Instructions for Collaborators + Django Basics

The SCOPE data collection 2GZM demo website is implemented in a Python web framework called Django. All you need is a laptop, a Python installation, and a browser for testing the website. 

### Backend Setup

Setting up the website on your local computer is fairly easy: 

1. Install Python 3 (if you don't already have it). 
2. Install the dependencies. These are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed easily via the commandline: `pip install -r 'path/to/scope/requirements.txt'`.
3. Clone/copy this repository to your local computer. As a collaborator, you should have access to view and make changes to this repository in your GitHub account. Open GitHub Desktop, and in the top menu choose `File -> Clone Repository -> scope`. 
4. Make note of the local path where you copied the `scope` project folder, this is the folder you'll be working in. 
5. Connect to the website database. The website connects to an external MySQL database and requires the database login credentials to be stored in a file called `db_config.cnf`. Contact @joegenius98 to get access to this file, and save it in the top-level project folder. 

That should be all you need to work on developing and testing the website codebase. 

### Frontend Setup

1. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). (Last version used: `16.7.1`)
2. Navigate to the [`frontend`](frontend) folder 
3. `npm install` (Last version used: `8.15.0`)
4. `npm start`

As an alternative to `npm`, you can use `yarn`. I'm not too certain as how it compares to `npm`,
but I have heard it can be better.

1. `curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash`
2. Check that `yarn` installed successfully with `yarn --version` (Last version used: `1.22.19`)
3. Navigate to the [`frontend`](frontend) folder
4. Run `yarn` (which will automatically install from `package.json`)
5. `yarn run`

### A brief overview of the project folder

The `scope` project folder contains all the files and folders needed to make the SCOPE website/platform work. Here's an overview of the top level folder structure that you'll need to know about:

- `scope`
	- `core`
		This folder controls the workings and settings of the "main" website, such as the home or about pages. 
	- `apps`
		This folder contains one or more "apps" -- self-contained mini websites that are nested within the main website. In our case, each "app" is a SCOPE workflow "module", since these are independent website components that may or may not be included for different SCOPE data coding projects. 
	- `examples`
		... 
	- `resources`
		... 

### Testing the website

Before submitting a new commit, it's sometimes a good idea to check that your code works locally on your computer and see how your changes have impacted the website. This requires starting the Django development web-server, which you can do as follows:

1. Open a commandline window and type `python manage.py runserver`. This will run some basic checks of the website code and, if successfull, should display `Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK`. 
2. Open a webbrowser and go to the url `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. This should show your local version of the website. The data contents of the website however (such as rows in tables) is the same external MySQL database shared between all collaborators. 

As long as you keep the commandline window open, you'll be able to interact with the website. Plus, any changes you make to the code will immediately take effect (except when you make changes to the database, see below). 

### Making changes to the database

Whenever you have made changes to any of the data models in `models.py`, you will need to make sure these changes are registered to the central MySQL database:

1. In the commandline window, type `python manage.py makemigrations` (if the web server is running, you have to stop it first by pressing CTRL-C). This command tells django to make a record of what changes need to be made in the database, based on your changes in `models.py` (this is recorded in a file inside the `migrations` folder). 
2. Again in the commandline window, type `python manage.py migrate`. This is what actually applies the changes from the previous step to the database.
3. Start up the webserver again to see that your changes are reflected in the website. However, in most cases when you make changes to the database, the website will "break" and you'll see some errors. You'll need to update the code in whichever scripts rely on those data models. Read the errors -- they'll help you identify what needs fixing. 

If all goes well, whatever changes you made locally in `models.py` will be reflected in the external MySQL database shared by everyone.
