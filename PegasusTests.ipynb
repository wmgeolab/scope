The problem is that Twitter is saddled with $13 billion in debt—seven times the company\\'s projected earnings for 2022—and only has $632 million in cash on hand last year, NPR reports. \"It\\'s hypothetically possible that he could use more of his Tesla stock to bail out Twitter, or turn to his cadre of co-investors, who would probably have no trouble finding the money,\" says Andy Wu, an assistant professor at Harvard\\'s business school. \"The saying,\\'If you owe the bank $100, that\\'s your problem, but if you owe the bank $100 million, that\\'s the bank\\'s problem\\' might apply here.\" If Twitter does file for bankruptcy, it could help Musk by allowing him to refinance the debt, which would make the company \"more financially stable,\" says Wu. But even if Twitter does file for bankruptcy, it would likely operate as normal, says Wu. \"In addition to potential financial returns, my sense is that Musk and his co-investors are ideologically driven, that they',\n",

Musk laid off half of the staff when he bought the company for $44 billion last month, and he told employees this week that they are now required to come into the office for a minimum of 40 hours per week, ending the company\\'s work-from-home policy. \"We need roughly half of our revenue to be subscription,\" he wrote, referring to the company\\'s controversial blue checkmark subscription service. \"Over the next few days, the absolute top priority is finding and suspending any verified bots/trolls/spam,\" he wrote. \"Going forward, accounts engaged in parody must include \\'parody\\' in their name, not just in bio.\" He also noted that going forward, \"accounts engaged in parody must include \\'parody\\' in their name, not just in bio.\"',\n",

On Saturday, some contractors found out they\\'d been fired when they were locked out of their work accounts. Similarly, many of Twitter\\'s full-time employees found out the same when they lost access to work platforms like Slack and email. Some contractors work in content moderation, which had already been hit with layoffs. According to journalist Casey Newton, other departments, such as real estate and marketing, were also affected by contractor layoffs. Some contractors told Axios they were worried about whether or not they would be able to receive their final paycheck. Melissa Ingle, a content moderation contractor, told Axios that she was worried about how the layoffs would affect her and her family financially. \"This is no way to treat people,\" Ingle told Axios. Twitter and representatives for Musk did not immediately respond to Insider\\'s request for comment. On Nov. 4, Twitter—under the new ownership of Musk—cut its full-time employee workforce by nearly 50%. Now, Musk is reportedly planning to slash roughly half of Twitter\\'s 7,500 employees this week.

Among the experiments was a satellite dubbed the FalconSat-8 that was designed and built by academy cadets in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory. It was deployed in October 2021 and still remains in orbit. “This mission highlights the Space Force’s focus on collaboration in space exploration and expanding low-cost access to space for our partners, within and outside of the Department of the Air Force,” said Gen.
